strategies:

    impacts the region's ability to support young families and a thriving economy.
    Half the region's renters are housing cost burdened, meaning they spend more than
    30% of their household income on rent, and 30% of the region's homeowners are
    cost burdened. Policy responses to these drivers include boosting our supply of

Policies that encourage diversity do not necessarily promote inclusiveness. Immigrants, both documented and undocumented, are a critical component of Metro Boston’s economy and culture. Policies that exclude and ostracize immigrants reduce opportunities for them to engage civically, limiting the region’s progress and ability to thrive. New punitive federal immigration policies puts the onus on local governments to enact and enforce policies that make immigrants feel safe and encourages them to engage with the people and placed around them.
