  recreation

strategies:
- title: 'Expand transportation options, particularly for underserved populations
    and communities of color, and decrease transportation costs for cost-burdened
    households. '
  text: The region’s commuters of color spend more time commuting than their White
    counterparts. Without a range of convenient transportation options, particularly
    public transit and safe pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, marginalized communities
    have limited mobility options and yet are likely to experience disproportionate
    impacts from vehicular emissions. These same communities often spend a disproportionate
    percentage of their household incomes on transportation costs. As MBTA, Commuter
    Rail and event Regional Transit costs continue to rise, we have seen a steady
    decrease in the real dollar value of the gas tax since 1996. Equitable transportation
    means providing a range of travel options to low-income communities and communities
    of color, all of which are affordable, reliable, safe and sustainable.
  policies:
  - title: Enact Regional Transportation Ballot Initiatives to support active transportation
      investments
    text: This legislation would allow a municipality or group of municipalities to
      raise additional local money for transportation projects via a ballot initiative,
      giving voters a more direct role in the transportation funding process and creating
      a lock box of funds for specific investments. In many communities across our
      region, we expect that these funds would be used to create alternative transportation
      investments, or to increase investments in the existing system. At the same
      time, a frequent criticism of this local option funding mechanism is that it
      will only truly be available to wealthier communities. If it is passed, the
      Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) should ensure that lower-income
      communities have more access to statewide resources.
  - title: Implement road-pricing systems that incentivize public transit use
    text: Several cities across the United States have implemented congestion-pricing
      schemes. While congestion-pricing could be regressive, if implemented here,
      the region has the opportunity to devise a strategy that funnels new money directly
      to public transit and offers exemptions to vehicle-dependent low-income families.
  - title: Implement low-income fares for the MBTA, Commuter Rail and RTAs
    text: 'The MBTA could implement a low-income fare policy whereby riders pay fares
      on a sliding scale based on their income. Additionally, the MBTA should create
      a fare-capping program for riders who pay per trip, rather than for a daily
      or monthly pass, and ensure that they don’t pay more than the cost of the currently
      offered passes. '

- title: Adopt equitable decision-making frameworks for transportation planning and
    project development
  text: An essential part of everyday life for most is travel from home to work or
    to goods and services. The region’s transportation systems is the foundation of
    making commute and utilitarian travel possible and the system is sustained through
    public- and private-sector investment. The transportation system that we have
    is also the result of public- and private-sector planning processes, which can
    tend to focus more heavily on areas that are undergoing economic growth and on
    areas where communities have the capacity to participate in decision-making. Since
    the system serves all in the region, decisions should not only favor a few or
    overly burden specific groups of people, such as households of color who are disproportionately
    burdened by higher transportation costs and longer commute times. We can create
    a more equitable system through greater investments in active transportation modes
    and leading more inclusive planning processes.
  policies:
  - title: Create and enforce developer mitigation policies that direct more funding
      to walking, biking and public transit infrastructure.
    text: Through the development review process, cities and towns should require
      developers to conduct impact studies and manage congestion impacts by making
      bicycle, pedestrian and transit investments. Legislation to assist municipalities,
      the MassDOT and the MBTA create a framework that would direct (additional) developer
      mitigation funds to support transit service and walking and biking infrastructure
      would ensure that such investments are no longer one-off occurrences and are
      a regular investment from new development, especially in locations that rely
      more heavily on non-vehicular travel for daily travel.
  - title: Offer technical assistance funding to support design for low-income communities.
    text: 'The Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) is the process by which federal
      transportation dollars are allocated to cities and towns in Massachusetts. The
      current scoring criteria favorably views projects that advance equity and support
      environmental justice communities, but requires that projects be at 25% design
      before they are submitted to the TIP. This can be a significant cost burden
      for communities and can create a barrier for those communities that already
      have transit-dependent residents or have transit deserts. A program to increase
      technical assistance to those communities to help them reach 25% design could
      help level the playing field for access to federal transportation dollars. '
  - title: 'Update Project Selection Criteria to more holistically consider existing
      conditions and differences in outcomes '
    text: Transportation agencies such as Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs),
      and often municipal public works departments, use a set of project evaluation
      criteria to identify priority transportation-related capital investments, given
      constrained financial situations and long range plans. While some progress has
      occurred, many selection criteria continue to prioritize capital and maintenance
      activities that support single occupant automobile travel. Fortunately, there
      are more resources available that allow consideration of a broader set of factors
      and impacts so that criteria promote more equitable outcomes. MPOs and cities
      and towns can put in place policies that place more emphasis on project characteristics
      such as proximity of high volume roadways to residential and education uses,
      socioeconomic context, and access to employment as well as on estimated project
      outcomes on factors like greenhouse gas emissions, displacement risk, injuries,
      and vegetative cover.
  best_practice:
    text: "## Emerging Practice: Racial equity impact assessments\nRacial equity impact
      assessments analyze the impact of budget and policy decisions on racial and
      ethnic groups and identify ways to mitigate the possible consequences of these
      decisions. They seek to root out bias while promoting equity, inclusion, and
      opportunity. These assessments can be applied to any policy or decision making
      process. \n\nKing County, Washington created an Equity Impact Review (EIR) toolkit
      for informing more equitable budgets, policies, and decision making. The King
      County Department of Transportation uses it to make equitable decisions on service
      reductions or enhancements. The Parks Department uses the EIR to more fairly
      distribute parks, open space, trails, and Farmer’s Market by race, income, and
      language spoken. The county also applied the EIR during the creation of their
      2012 budget, which resulted in extra allocations to truancy prevention, youth
      programming in diverse low income areas, and economic development opportunities
      in low income communities.\n"

Metro Boston’s residents depend on the region’s transportation system to connect them to school, work, services, and recreational activities. Despite the many ways residents of the region get around, transportation improvements have tended to promote one form of travel – driving alone – rather than emphasizing access to destinations regardless of how a person travels. As a result, many residents face substantial challenges when commuting to work, getting to the doctor’s office, or visiting friends. This is especially true for low-income households who do not own or cannot afford a vehicle, young people and older adults who cannot drive, and people with mobility impairments. Those individual and household constraints are compounded by historical and ongoing disparities in transit service available for low-income communities and communities of color.
