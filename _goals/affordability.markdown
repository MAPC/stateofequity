strategies:
- title: Low and moderate income residents can afford to live in any part of the region
    they choose
  text: The lack of affordable housing options for all of Metro Boston residents impacts
    the region's ability to support young families and a thriving economy. Half the
    region's renters are housing cost burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of
    their household income on rent, and 30% of the region's homeowners are cost burdened.
    Policy responses to these drivers include boosting our supply of affordable.
  policies:
  - title: Enact Regional Transportation Ballot Initiative Automatic voter registration
    text: This legislation would enable a municipality or a group of municipalities
      to raise additional local money for transportation projects via ballot initiatives,
      giving voters a more direct role in the process and also showing a clearer correlation
      between funds being raised and the project(s) for which those funds are used.
  - title: Reduce MBTA fares for low income riders and enact fare capping policies.

  - title: Reduce and cap fines for fare evasion and do away with penalties for unpaid
      fines.

- title: Expand transportation options and run them more frequently for underserved
    populations and communities of color
  text: Our analysis shows that the region’s commuters of color often spend longer
    commuting than their White counterparts. Without a range of convenient transportation
    options, particularly public transit and safe pedestrian/bicycle infrastructure,
    marginalized communities may experience disproportionate impacts from vehicular
    emissions.

    text: Cities and towns across the country offer training to municipal employees
      to learn how to engage with undocumented residents and with government agencies
      like the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. In Portland, Oregon the
      Human Resources Bureau, along with the Office of Equity and Human Rights and

      respond to federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Metro Boston’s residents depend on the region’s transportation system to connect them to school, work, services, and recreational activities. Despite the many ways residents of the region get around, transportation improvements have tended to promote one form of travel – driving alone – rather than emphasizing access to destinations regardless of how a person travels. As a result, many residents face substantial challenges when commuting to work, getting to the doctor’s office, or visiting friends. This is especially true for low-income households who do not own or cannot afford a vehicle, young people and older adults who cannot drive, and people with mobility impairments. Those individual and household constraints are compounded by historical and ongoing disparities in transit service available for low-income communities and communities of color.
