- title: "i.\tExpand transportation options, particularly for underserved populations
    and communities of color, and decrease transportation costs for cost-burdened
    households. "
  text: The region’s commuters of color spend more time commuting than their White
    counterparts. Without a range of convenient transportation options, particularly
    public transit and safe pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, marginalized communities
    have limited mobility options and yet are likely to experience disproportionate
    impacts from vehicular emissions. These same communities often spend a disproportionate
    percentage of their household incomes on transportation costs. As MBTA, Commuter
    Rail and event Regional Transit costs continue to rise, we have seen a steady
    decrease in the real dollar value of the gas tax since 1996. Equitable transportation
    means providing a range of travel options to low-income communities and communities
    of color, all of which are affordable, reliable, safe and sustainable.
  policies:
  - title: Enact Regional Transportation Ballot Initiatives to support active transportation
      investments
    text: This legislation would allow a municipality or group of municipalities to
      raise additional local money for transportation projects via a ballot initiative,
      giving voters a more direct role in the transportation funding process and creating
      a lock box of funds for specific investments. In many communities across our
      region, we expect that these funds would be used to create alternative transportation
      investments, or to increase investments in the existing system, particularly
      in areas that are underserved by transit or active transportation options.

  - title: Implement road-pricing systems that incentivize public transit use
    text: |-
      Several cities across the United States, including Minneapolis, Housing and San Diego have implemented congestion-pricing schemes. If implemented here, we have the opportunity to devise a strategy that funnels new money directly to public transit and offers financial exemptions to vehicle-dependent low-income families.[^10]

  - title: Implement low-income fares for the MBTA, Commuter Rail and RTAs
    text: The MBTA could implement a low-income fare policy whereby riders pay fares
      on a sliding scale based on their income. Additionally, the MBTA should create
      a fare-capping program for riders who pay per trip, rather than for a daily
      or monthly pass, and ensure that they don’t pay more than the cost of the currently
      offered passes.

    text: Bus Rapid Transit pilot programs are springing up along three key corridors
      in the MBTA service area. Bus Rapid Transit is often seen as a more cost-friendly
      alternative to building new rail corridors along some of our busiest transit
      routes. Continuing to expand the existing pilot program in low-income communities
      and communities of color could help to address inequities in our existing transit
      system. MAPC will continue to play a role in helping the MBTA to determine which
      corridors should be prioritized and to determine the impact of removing parking
      to accommodate a new dedicated bus lane.

- title: "ii.\tAdopt equitable decision-making frameworks for transportation planning
    and project development"
  text: |-
    An essential part of everyday life for most is travel from home to work, school, shopping, services, or recreation. The region’s transportation system is the foundation of making travel possible, and the system is sustained mainly through public investment. The transportation system that we have is also the result of the public sector planning process, which can tend to focus more heavily on areas that are undergoing economic growth and on areas where communities have the capacity to participate in decision-making. Since the system serves all in the region, decisions should not only favor a few or overly burden specific groups of people, such as households of color who are disproportionately burdened by higher transportation costs and longer commute times.[^11] We can create a more equitable system by leading with more inclusive planning processes, greater investments in active transportation modes, improvement to all elements of the public transit system (rail, subway, and bus), and ensuring investments in under-served communities (low-income communities not well served by transit, as well as rural and less development areas in need of greater connectivity and improved mobility.

  policies:
  - title: Create and enforce developer mitigation policies that direct more funding
      to walking, biking and public transit infrastructure.
    text: Through the development review process, the Commonwealth and municipalities
      should require developers to conduct impact studies, providing appropriate mitigation
      for project impacts, and helping to manage congestion.  Such investments should
      include those that improve transit, bicycle, and pedestrian options, in addition
      to appropriate roadway improvements. Statues, regulations, and guidelines can
      help MassDOT, the MBTA, and Regional Transit Authorities to ensure that such
      investments are no longer one-off occurrences, but rather are a regular type
      of investment, especially in locations that rely more heavily on non-vehicular
      modes for daily travel.

  - title: Offer technical assistance funding to support design for low-income communities.
    text: The Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) is the process by which federal
      transportation dollars are allocated to cities and towns in Massachusetts. The
      current scoring criteria favorably view projects that advance equity and support
      environmental justice communities, but requires that projects be at 25% design
      before they are submitted to the TIP. This can be a significant cost burden
      for communities and can create a barrier for those communities that already
      have transit-dependent residents or have transit deserts. It can also be a barrier
      for smaller, rural, or more outlying communities facing severe budget challenges.  A
      program to increase technical assistance to such communities to help them reach
      25% design could help to level the playing field for access to federal transportation
      dollars.

  - title: Update Project Selection Criteria to consider existing conditions and differences
      in outcomes in a more holistic manner.
    text: Much attention has been paid to ways of improving project selection criteria
      used by the Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) for federal transportation
      dollars, and by the Commonwealth for state funds.  We have made progress to
      ensure that funding goes to projects in Environmental Justice communities as
      well as areas ill-served by transit, but additional consideration should be
      given to assessing projects by using “accessibility standards,” which focus
      on the ability of transportation improvements to help people from various parts
      of the region to access job and educational opportunities.  Such standards could
      unify various constituencies in the region who need better access to jobs and
      schools, from lower-income urban residents, to isolated immigrant communities,
      and rural residents of outlying areas.

Metro Boston’s residents depend on the region’s transportation system to connect them to school, work, services, and recreational activities. Despite the many ways residents of the region get around, transportation improvements have tended to promote one form of travel – driving alone – rather than emphasizing access to destinations regardless of how a person travels. As a result, many residents face substantial challenges when commuting to work or school, getting to the doctor’s office, or visiting friends. This is especially true for low-income households who do not own or cannot afford a vehicle, young people and older adults who cannot drive, and people with mobility impairments. Those individual and household constraints are compounded by historical and ongoing disparities in transit service available for low-income communities and communities of color.[^8][^9]
