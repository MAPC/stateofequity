- title: End disparate incarceration rates and incidence of deaths by law enforcement
    actions among populations of color.
  text: "People of color are disproportionately represented in the Massachusetts criminal
    justice system. Sentencing policies, particularly the application of mandatory
    minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenses, are one significant cause of
    this disparity. Implicit and explicit racial bias in policing and arrests is also
    seen as contributing to higher levels of convictions and tougher sentencing for
    people of color. Incidents of violence between Black and Latino men and law enforcement,
    and the increased visibility of these incidents through social media and activism,
    have raised awareness of ongoing tensions between police and minority communities.
    State and municipal leaders therefore must work to change sentencing policies
    and support efforts by law enforcement to build community trust.[^57]\n\n[^57]:

  policies:
  - title: Continue to emphasize community policing, engagement and proactive interventions.
    text: Boston’s Police Department and others around the region have long been considered
      models of community policing and engagement, working to build stronger relationships
      in neighborhoods and with a range of community leaders, such as clergy. The
      use of neighborhood advisory councils, the community ombudsman program and the
      institution of procedures that ensure dialogue with minority community leaders
      after incidents of violence between police and community residents are important
      elements of this approach, as we have seen in Boston and Somerville’s Teen Empowerment
      program. Similarly in Cambridge, the police department works with the schools
      and public health officials to identify at-risk young people before they get
      caught in the criminal justice system. These approaches should be maintained
      and expanded across the region.

  - title: Repeal mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses.
    text: Mandatory minimum sentences require judges to impose a predetermined term
      of incarceration for individuals convicted of committing certain offenses, such
      as distributing illegal narcotics. The sentences are levied regardless of a
      defendant’s criminal history or other mitigating factors. This sentencing practice
      has driven higher incarceration rates, particularly for Black and Latino men.  People
      sentenced to mandatory minimum often aren’t eligible for early release programs
      or other transition programs, which ultimately results in an increased risk
      of recidivism. The range of crimes triggering minimum sentences should be scaled
      back, especially for non-violent drug-related offenses, enabling judges to consider
      a range of factors in determining sentences.

  - title: Require police departments to conduct implicit bias and de-escalation trainings.
    text: Implicit racial bias can have a profound effect on the relationship between
      law enforcement officers and residents. Training related to implicit bias, the
      use of force and interacting with individuals suffering from conditions such
      as mental illness and substance abuse problems can help improve police and community
      relations. Six cities around the country are currently participating in the
      National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice, and local communities
      should seek to follow suit. Funding to enable officers from across the state
      to take such trainings, which are offered by organizations such as the NAACP
      would encourage participation. Local police departments could also require officers
      to take bias training, as a bill before the legislature proposes.

    text: 'Some studies have shown that when police officers wear body cameras, it
      can improve the police-resident encounter. Other research suggests that body
      cameras do not improve the relationship or the trust between the police and
      residents. Boston recently implemented a 100-camera study, and the results of
      this study, and studies in other cities across the nation, should inform whether
      body cameras become required for all law enforcement officers while they are
      on duty. '

- title: Transition to a restorative justice framework that focuses on rehabilitation
    and re-integration
  text: Research shows that increasing incarceration rates has minimal impact on reducing
    crime, and that between 2010 and 2015, crime dropped faster in states that had
    declining rates of incarceration.[^58] In addition, as a society, we recognize
    that we imprison people at a much higher rate than our peer countries while at
    the same time that our focus on punishment may serve as barrier for integrating
    formerly incarcerated people back into our communities. As we look to update our
    reform our justice system, we should adopt a framework of restorative justice.
    Restorative justice focuses on the harm caused, the roots of its effects as well
    as its cause, and engagement of those involved – wrongdoer, victims and community
    – as a way to heal and address the harm done. It provides a mechanism to seek
    justice as well as a way to knit community back together, rather than splintering
    it, and states like Colorado and Vermont have instituted laws to enable its use.
    We should also not stop with restoration. We must support current efforts to address
    the socio-cultural roots of crime that reflect past prejudices and that often
    ignore context and effects on families.
  policies:
  - title: Limit solitary confinement in all Massachusetts correctional facilities
    text: Human rights organizations, legal scholars, health professionals, and advocates
      all agree that solitary confinement is a violation of basic human rights and
      should be abolished or severely restricted. Most proponents agree that inmates
      should only be kept in solitary confinement if they pose a threat to the prison
      population and they should be given special behavioral programming to address
      the underlying issues. Any inmate in solitary confinement must experience humane
      treatment and be given access to regular programs and services.

  - title: Raise juvenile jurisdiction from 18 to 21 and expunge juvenile records.
    text: "Currently 18-year-olds are automatically tried as adults in Massachusetts,
      but many advocates argue that this should be raised to 21 for some offenses.
      There is significant evidence to suggest that the adult brain isn’t fully formed
      until a person is closer to 20 years old, and that the differences in brain
      development lead to challenges with impulse control. Young people who remain
      in the juvenile justice system are far more likely to finish school and receive
      workforce training or coaching than those who land in adult justice systems.
      \n\nWhen 18-year-olds are tried as adults and sent to adult prisons, they are
      at greater risk of recidivism and developing mental health issues.[^59] Juvenile
      records are typically sealed, but if young people commit crimes and are tried
      as adults, the records will follow them for the rest of their life. \n\n[^59]:Foster

  - title: Eliminate “fine time” and better evaluate low-income defendants’ ability
      to pay.
    text: In the last eight years, 48 states, including Massachusetts, have increased
      civil and/or criminal fees that are assessed on defendants. Debt accumulated
      through court-imposed fines and fees can show up on an individual’s credit score
      and consequently affect their ability to secure housing or employment. In Massachusetts,
      criminal defendants who cannot afford to pay court-imposed fines can be ordered
      to serve jail time, adding $30 per day onto their debt until it is resolved.
      This practice disproportionately affects low-income people of color. Some proposals
      would allow the court officer to determine a defendants’ ability to pay before
      assessing fines and fees, and would create a more flexible fine system.

  - title: Allow for community-based sentencing alternatives for people convicted
      of nonviolent crimes.
    text: "Data suggests that incarceration, especially over longer periods of time,
      is correlated with recidivism. While prisons may serve to protect our communities
      from those who have a high risk to offend, these same prisons can end up holding
      many who have committed non-violent crimes. Placing these non-violent offenders
      in prison may contribute to the risk of physical and mental health issues, does
      add to the economic burden of our prison system, and, most importantly, removes
      these individuals, especially women and caretakers, from families and neighborhoods
      that rely on them. Many states, including California and New York, have taken
      steps to eliminate mandatory sentencing for non-violent offenders and to create
      programmatic alternatives to hold the offenders accountable for their behavior
      while reducing the potential for lasting negative outcomes from involvement
      in the prison system. An example of this legislation in Massachusetts is the
      Primary Caretakers bill which would keep parents and children together as the
      parent fulfills their obligations under a community-based sentencing alternative.[^60]\n\n[^60]:http://justiceashealing.org/current-legislation/ "

    text: "Cheshire T.R.U.E. Prison Program, Connecticut: In March 2017, Governor
      Dannel Malloy announced that Connecticut Department of Corrections would build
      a new facility to house inmates ages 18-25. The Governor partnered with the
      Vera Institute of Justice on this project. This age group has the highest rates
      of recidivism and the T.R.U.E. (Truthfulness, Respectfulness, Understanding,
      and Elevating) program aims to target this group of inmates differently from
      the adult population and provide special programming and services. \n\nIn Massachusetts,
      Middlesex County Sheriff Peter Koutoujian announced a new program that will
      house offenders aged 18-24 in a separate facility beginning in February 2018.
      This is an initiative in collaboration with the Vera Institute of Justice and
      UTEC. This program is modeled on Connecticut’s T.R.U.E. program. According to
      the Sheriff’s office, “Nationwide, 18- to 24-year-olds comprise 10 percent of
      the population, but account for 21 percent of all individuals admitted to adult
      prisons each year.”[^61]\n\n[^61]:Middlesex Sheriff’s Office. MSO to Open Young

As of January 1, 2016, there were over 10,000 people in prison in Massachusetts Department of Correction facilities. Among the incarcerated, Black and Latino inmates are severely over-represented. While the state population is 7% Black and 11% Latino, the state’s inmates are 27% Black and 25% Latino. We must work to reduce the incarceration rate overall and address the racial inequities in our justice system. We must also do more to support released prisoners as they reenter society.
