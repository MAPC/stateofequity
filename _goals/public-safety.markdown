strategies:
- title: End disparate incarceration rates among populations of color
  text: 'People of color are disproportionately overrepresented in the Massachusetts
    criminal justice system and throughout the country. There can be no denying that
    “implicit and explicit racial bias in policing and arrests lead to more convictions
    and tougher sentencing of people of color.” Recent killings of unarmed black men
    by police and increased visibility of these incidents through social media and
    activism have raised the profile of the issue, and these experiences lead to mistrust
    of law enforcement personnel. Legislators and policy experts must address implicit
    bias, and must also find solutions to regain community trust. '
  policies:
  - title: Require police departments to conduct implicit bias trainings
    text: In the context of criminal justice, implicit bias has a profound effect
      on the relationship between law enforcement officers and residents. Six cities
      around the country are currently participating in the National Initiative for
      Building Community Trust and Justice, and a bill is currently pending in the
      State House that would require implicit bias training for law enforcement officers
      in Massachusetts. If we can acknowledge and reduce implicit bias, then we can
      reduce the incidence of unlawful arrests and convictions in communities of color,
      and help to strengthen relationships between police and community members, which
      can have a profound effect on our communities and residents of color in the
      Commonwealth.

  - title: Pass legislation to require that a special prosecutor conduct investigations
      into death from a police shooting.
    text: 'The current system to investigate police misconduct has raised questions
      of impartiality across the country. Police departments and prosecutors of the
      same jurisdiction typically work together and rely on one another throughout
      their careers. When prosecutors use special grand juries in a matter of police
      misconduct, there is a legitimate question about whether a conflict of interest
      exists. If the Attorney General were to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate
      police misconduct, it would address this potential conflict of interest and
      serve as a means to improve transparency and accountability. '

  callout: MA Department of Correction facilities imprison three times the number
    of Black and Latino inmates than in our non prison population
  best_practice:
    text: 'Some studies have shown that when police officers wear body cameras, it
      can improve the police-resident encounter. Other research suggests that body
      cameras do not improve the relationship or the trust between the police and
      residents. Boston recently implemented a 100-camera study, and the results of
      this study should inform whether body cameras become required for all law enforcement
      officers while they are on duty. '

      while they are on duty.'

- title: Transition to a restorative justice framework that focuses on rehabilitation
    and re-integration
  text: Research shows that increasing incarceration rates has minimal impact on reducing
    crime, and that between 2010 and 2015, crime dropped faster in states that had
    declining rates of incarceration. Massachusetts still uses several outmoded forms
    of extreme punishment that are not shown to meaningfully reduce recidivism rates.
    As we look to update our criminal justice system, we should adopt a framework
    of restorative justice (i.e., one that repair of harm and rehabilitation) and
    of addressing the socio-cultural roots of crime that can impact our communities.
  policies:
  - title: Limit solitary confinement in all Massachusetts correctional facilities
    text: "Human rights organizations, legal scholars, health professionals and advocates
      all agree that solitary confinement is a violation of basic human rights and
      should be abolished or severely restricted. Most proponents agree that inmates
      should only be kept in solitary confinement if they pose a threat to the prison
      population and they should be given special behavioral programming to address
      the underlying issues. Any inmate in solitary confinement must experience humane
      treatment and be given access to regular programs and services.\nRaise juvenile
      jurisdiction from 18 to 21 and expunge juvenile records.\nCurrently 18-year-olds
      are automatically tried as adults in Massachusetts, but many advocates argue
      that this should be raised to 21 for some offenses. There is significant evidence
      to suggest that the adult brain isn’t fully formed until a person is closer
      to 20 years old, and that the differences in brain development lead to challenges
      with impulse control. Young people who remain in the juvenile justice system
      are far more likely to finish school and receive workforce training or coaching
      than those who land in adult justice systems.\n \nWhen 18-year-olds are tried
      as adults and sent to adult prisons, they are at greater risk of recidivism
      and developing mental health issues. Juvenile records are typically sealed,
      but if a young person commits a crime and is tried as an adult, the record will
      follow them for the rest of their life."

  - title: Eliminate “fine time” and better evaluate low-income defendants’ ability
      to pay
    text: 'Since 2010, 48 states have increased civil and/or criminal fees that are
      assessed on defendants. Debt accumulated through court-imposed fines and fees
      can show up on an individual’s credit score and consequently affect their ability
      to secure housing or employment. In Massachusetts, criminal defendants who cannot
      afford to pay court-imposed fines can be ordered to serve jail time, adding
      $30 per day onto their debt until it is resolved. This practice disproportionately
      affects low-income people of color. Other proposals would allow the court officer
      to determine a defendants’ ability to pay before assessing fines and fees, and
      would create a more flexible fine system. '

  - title: Repeal mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses
    text: 'Mandatory minimum sentences can lead to over-incarceration that are disproportionate
      to the crimes committed. People sentenced to mandatory minimum often aren’t
      eligible for early release programs or other transition programs. Instead, particularly
      for nonviolent drug offenses, judges should have the ability to make sentencing
      decisions on a case-by-case basis. '

  - title: Allow for community-based sentencing alternatives for people convicted
      of nonviolent crimes
    text: Data suggests that incarceration, especially over longer periods of time,
      is correlated with recidivism. While prisons may serve to protect our communities
      from those who have a high risk to offend, these same prisons can end up holding
      many who have committed non-violent crimes. Placing these non-violent offenders
      in prison may contribute to the risk of physical and mental health issues, does
      add to the economic burden of our prison system, and, most importantly, removes
      these individuals, especially women and caretakers, from families and neighborhoods
      that rely on them. Many states, including California and New York, have taken
      steps to eliminate mandatory sentencing for non-violent offenders and create
      programmatic alternatives to hold the offenders accountable for their behavior
      while reducing the potential for lasting negative outcomes from involvement
      in the prison system. An example of this legislation in MA is the Primary Caretakers
      bill which would keep parents and children together as the either parent fulfills
      their obligations under a community-based sentencing alternative.

    text: "Cheshire T.R.U.E. Prison Program, Connecticut: In March 2017, Governor
      Malloy announced that Connecticut Department of Corrections would build a new
      facility to house inmates ages 18-25. The Governor partnered with the Vera Institute
      of Justice on this project. This age group has the highest rates of recidivism
      and the T.R.U.E. (Truthfulness, Respectfulness, Understanding, and Elevating)
      program aims to target this group of inmates differently from the adult population
      and provide special programming and services. \n\nIn Massachusetts, Middlesex
      County Sheriff Peter Koutoujian announced a new program that will house offenders
      age 18-24 in a separate facility beginning in February 2018. This is an initiative
      in collaboration with the Vera Institute of Justice and UTEC. This program is
      modeled on Connecticut’s T.R.U.E. program. According to the Sheriff’s office,
      “Nationwide, 18- to 24-year-olds comprise 10 percent of the population, but
      account for 21 percent of all individuals admitted to adult prisons each year."

As of January 1, 2016, there were over 10,000 people in prison in Massachusetts Department of Correction facilities. Among the incarcerated, Black and Latino inmates are severely overrepresented. While the state population is 7% Black and 11% Latino, the state’s inmates are 27% Black and 25% Latino. We must work to reduce the incarceration rate overall, close the racial incarceration gap, and address the racial inequities in our justice system. We must also do more to support released prisoners as they reenter society.
