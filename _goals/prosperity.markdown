strategies:
- title: Low and moderate income residents can afford to live in any part of the region
    they choose
  text: The lack of affordable housing options for all of Metro Boston residents impacts
    the region's ability to support young families and a thriving economy. Half the
    region's renters are housing cost burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of
    their household income on rent, and 30% of the region's homeowners are cost burdened.
    Policy responses to these drivers include boosting our supply of affordable.
  policies:
  - title: Enact Regional Transportation Ballot Initiative Automatic voter registration
    text: This legislation would enable a municipality or a group of municipalities
      to raise additional local money for transportation projects via ballot initiatives,
      giving voters a more direct role in the process and also showing a clearer correlation
      between funds being raised and the project(s) for which those funds are used.
  - title: Reduce MBTA fares for low income riders and enact fare capping policies.

      to raise additional local money for transportation projects via ballot initiatives,
      giving voters a more direct role in the process and also showing a clearer correlation

  - title: Reduce and cap fines for fare evasion and do away with penalties for unpaid
      fines.

- title: Expand transportation options and run them more frequently for underserved
    populations and communities of color
  text: Our analysis shows that the region’s commuters of color often spend longer
    commuting than their White counterparts. Without a range of convenient transportation
    options, particularly public transit and safe pedestrian/bicycle infrastructure,
    marginalized communities may experience disproportionate impacts from vehicular
    emissions.

    text: Cities and towns across the country offer training to municipal employees
      to learn how to engage with undocumented residents and with government agencies
      like the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. In Portland, Oregon the
      Human Resources Bureau, along with the Office of Equity and Human Rights and
      they City Attorney’s office developed a plan for training city workers how to
      respond to federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Policies that encourage diversity do not necessarily promote inclusiveness. Immigrants, both documented and undocumented, are a critical component of Metro Boston’s economy and culture. Policies that exclude and ostracize immigrants reduce opportunities for them to engage civically, limiting the region’s progress and ability to thrive. New punitive federal immigration policies puts the onus on local governments to enact and enforce policies that make immigrants feel safe and encourages them to engage with the people and placed around them.
