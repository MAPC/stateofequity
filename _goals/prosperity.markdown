- title: Remove barriers to employment
  text: In the Metro Boston, workers without college degrees, communities of color,
    and workers with a disability are disproportionately under-employed and unemployed.
    Many workplace policies continue to put up artificial barriers for employees in
    these demographics. Policy shifts could have a profound impact on employees who
    are often underpaid and working in inflexible situations. Additionally, Criminal
    Offender Record Information (CORI) forms continue to be a barrier for individuals
    who enter or return to the workforce after a criminal case. It is not only an
    employment barrier, but can also limit an individual’s eligibility for certain
    state assistance programs and their economic independence and socio-economic mobility.
    More attention is paid to CORI reform under the goal.
  policies:
  - title: Paid Family and Medical Leave
    text: "A current proposal in the MA Legislature would allow employees who are
      eligible under the current Massachusetts Parental Leave Act and federal Family
      and Medical Leave Act to take paid time off to recover from a serious illness
      or injury, to care for a seriously ill or injured family member, or to care
      for a new child. If passed, the legislation would provide critical financial
      security for employees who need to serve as a caretaker, extend the length of
      leave available to employees, and ensure that workers can keep their jobs once
      they return from leave. \n\nPaid Family and Medical Leave has the potential
      to particularly improve outcomes for women, minority and low-wage workers. This
      population is less likely to receive wage replacement when they take time off
      to attend to a personal illness or to care for a family member; they are also
      more likely to cut back on spending, dip into savings, and apply for public
      assistance since they cannot go without pay,. Employees without paid leave are
      also more likely to leave the workforce, which stifles professional growth and
      exacerbates wage inequality."

  - title: Increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour, and tie the increase to inflation
    text: |-
      Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the federal minimum wage for covered nonexempt employees is $7.25 per hour effective July 24, 2009. Many states also have minimum wage laws. Where an employee is subject to both the state and federal minimum wage laws, the employee is entitled to the higher minimum wage rate. The minimum wage in Massachusetts is set at $11.00 per hour.

      The declining value of the minimum wage is one of the primary causes of wage inequality between low and middle-income workers. The minimum wage should be increased to $15 an hour and be tied to the consumer price index to ensure that wages remain stable. In addition, the state should require companies to pay tipped worker $15 an hour and create exceptions to the minimum wage law to allow for an adjusted wage for employees between the ages of 16 and 18.

- title: Increase access to business ownership and employment/financial independence
  text: Small business creation is usually heralded as an opportunity for Americans
    to pursue their entrepreneurial spirit and provide jobs for their community. Unfortunately
    access to state and local resources to start a business are not necessarily accessible
    to everyone. Whether prospective entrepreneurs face bank loan discrimination,
    speak a foreign language, face difficulties with talent retention or lack financial
    resources, the region needs to do more to increase business ownership. We must
    incentivize the creation of small businesses and support objectives aimed at worker
    development.
  policies:
  - title: Technical assistance and small business development programs for worker-owned
      cooperatives
    text: Worker-owned cooperatives are companies owned and managed by employees who share
      decision-making powers and who control the profits produced through their labor. According
      to a recent study, about 60 percent of new cooperatives worker-owners since
      2010 are people of color and nearly 70% are women.  Co-ops provide an alternative
      to traditional corporations in many regards not least of which is that profits
      remain with the worker-owners and more likely in the surrounding community.
      The state and municipalities can help co-operatives form by providing bridge
      financing and creating predictable processes to establish them as well as technical
      assistance and spaces that help the cooperatives establish themselves.

- title: 'Facilitate intergenerational wealth transfer among low- and middle-income
    families

'
  text: |-
    According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s 2015 Report titled The Color of Wealth, “Nonwhite households have only a fraction of the net worth attributed to white households. While white households have a median wealth of $247,500, Dominicans and U.S. blacks have a median wealth of close to zero. Of all nonwhite groups for which estimates could be made, Caribbean black households have the highest median wealth with $12,000, which is only 5 percent of the wealth attributed to white households in the Boston MSA [Metropolitan Statistical Area].”

    This economic data demonstrates that barriers to employment and business ownership, as well as homeownership, have real consequences on an individual’s ability to save money, own assets and pass them on to their families. We must pass legislation and support programs that facilitate low-income and middle-income households to accumulate wealth and assets.
  policies:
  - title: Pass legislation aimed at curbing the “Cliff Effect” for individuals and
      families receiving state benefits
    text: "The “Cliff Effect” occurs when an individual or family receiving state
      benefits sees a sharp decline in those benefits as income increases. While many
      state benefit programs currently have an income or employment requirement, benefits
      generally decrease as income increases. The unintended result is either a disincentive
      toward economic mobility or a person working harder, with less financial stability.
      Program assistance should be tapered as individuals or families increase their
      incomes, rather than cutting off assistance at particular income levels. The
      state should also pass legislation that lifts the welfare benefit cap for families
      who have a child while receiving state assistance. \n"

    text: 'Residents can experience displacement as residential buildings are sold
      to new ownership. This can be particularly harmful for properties that have
      provide affordable homes for households earning low- and moderate-incomes. A
      Tenant First Right Purchase Option protection, when adopted by a municipality,
      would stipulate that owners of residential properties must provide current tenants
      an chance to purchase the property at a fair market price and terms before the
      owner can transfer the property to a third party. When coupled with a low-interest
      loans, the first right purchase option provides an avenue to homeownership,
      and wealth creation, for low- and moderate-income families. '

While the Metro Boston’s regional economy has been growing robustly since the Great Recession, not everyone has benefitted equally from that growth. Participation rates for people with a high school degree are 12 percentage points lower than the rates for those with a bachelor’s degree, and trending downward. The unemployment rate for workers who are Black is nearly 7 percentage points higher than the rate for workers who are White, and the Latino rate is nearly 5 points higher. The unemployment rate for people with a disability is more than ten percentage points higher than for people without a disability. 

A good job can be defined as employment that respects workers’ rights, provides opportunity for upward mobility, ensures safe working conditions, pays a living wage, is free from any type of discrimination or harassment, and provides meaningful benefits. Well-paying jobs represent the difference between economic security and financial instability, and studies show that good jobs have a direct tie to educational attainment opportunities among families and the ability to live in healthier homes and neighborhoods. 

MAPC’s work on income inequality seeks to advance policies that improve the economic vitality of all by supporting financial independence for residents, beginning with those who have the greatest economic needs in our region.
