- title: Enhance community resilience and sustainability to meet the present and future
    challenges
  text: We must make investments that strengthen communities by better preparing individuals
    and families to deal with natural hazards like floods and heat waves as well as
    meet the new challenges we expect from these natural events. We can build a more
    resilient region by making structural investments that foster community resiliency
    as well as positioning our residents to benefit from new technologies that are
    intended to increase economic and energy security.
  policies:
  - title: Expand the Mass Solar Loan Program to more effectively reach low-income
      households that are credit invisible or have unscored credit records.
    text: As of the close of 2017, the Mass Solar Loan Program is close to full utilization
      of the funding allocated to the program. Only 13% of Mass Solar Loan recipients
      had FICO scores equal to or lower than 680, and over 70% of the loans went to
      recipients with FICO scores over 720. Solstice, a community solar provider,
      is currently researching and testing an alternative to FICO scores called an
      Energy Score, that takes into consideration to utility payment performance,
      housing characteristics, financial characteristics, and demographic characteristics
      to establish a more inclusive and accurate prediction of whether or not a participant
      is considered low risk. Removing the Mass Solar Loan Program’s reliance on FICO
      scores to categorize participants and incorporation of an alternative Energy
      Score, such as Solstice’s, would increase access for households that stand to
      benefit the most from participation in the Program. The Mass Solar Program needs
      additional funding in order to expand this valuable program to more effectively
      support low-income households.

  - title: Protect at-risk populations from current and future environmental hazards.
    text: The legislature is currently considering a proposal that would require that
      all residents who live in the Commonwealth have equal environmental justice,
      and all executive Secretariats develop policies and strategies to achieve environmental
      justice. This would include the appointment of a Director of Environmental Justice
      at the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs.  The proposal also
      creates a supplemental fund to support environmentally beneficial projects in
      low-income communities. The proposal is particularly important because we often
      see low-income communities living in climate-vulnerable locations. As superstorms
      and chemicals impact our municipalities, we have to make sure that all residents
      live somewhere they can expect to remain safe from climate hazards.

  - title: Provide a comprehensive energy efficiency program offering to effectively
      meet the needs of moderate-income customers and renters across the Commonwealth.
    text: The low-income energy efficiency program in Massachusetts is a leader in
      the clean energy field, but it is limited to serving households at or below
      60% of Area Median Income. The energy efficiency Program Administrators were
      instructed to roll out a moderate-income offer, but the impacts of this will
      be difficult to measure. We must continue to engage in robust advocacy to ensure
      that the needs of historically underserved populations are met by the state’s
      energy efficiency programs at the same time as we identify and approval additional
      program funding mechanisms, especially for moderate income customers.

  - title: Establish and fund a pilot program for shared electric vehicle services
      in Environmental Justice communities.
    text: Low-income families of color are less likely to own a vehicle than white
      and high-income families. Additionally, households in the lower third of the
      income range dedicate more of their household income to transportation costs
      than the upper third of the national income range. Providing shared mobility
      services with electric vehicles that have zero tail pipe emissions within environmental
      justice communities can potentially improve access to opportunity and improve
      local air quality through reduced emissions. The state will need to allocate
      significant new resources to support a successful program. Along with other
      New England states, Massachusetts is currently considering a regional cap and
      trade program for transportation-related emissions. If this passes, it could
      be a significant new source of funding available to reinvest in programs and
      initiatives designed to reduce emissions from the transportation sector.

      text: "Climate Justice recognizes that the negative effects of climate change
        fall most harshly on those who contributed the least to its causes, low income
        communities and communities of color. As the climate changes these populations
        will be the first to face negative health outcomes, financial hardships and
        social and cultural disruptions. Climate Justice Proponents seek to spread
        these burdens of climate change as well as the benefits addressing climate
        change will create. \n\nIn 2012 California created a model for climate justice
        legislation passing a bill that allocates resources to the communities most
        hurt by climate change. Twenty-five percent of proceeds from California’s
        Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund will pay for projects in disadvantaged communities,
        which they identify through the CalEnviroScreen, a screening methodology used
        to identify communities that are burdened by multiple sources of pollution."

- title: Expand transportation options and run them more frequently for underserved
    populations and communities of color
  text: Our analysis shows that the region’s commuters of color often spend longer
    commuting than their White counterparts. Without a range of convenient transportation
    options, particularly public transit and safe pedestrian/bicycle infrastructure,
    marginalized communities may experience disproportionate impacts from vehicular
    emissions.

    text: This legislation would enable a municipality or a group of municipalities
      to raise additional local money for transportation projects via ballot initiatives,
      giving voters a more direct role in the process and also showing a clearer correlation
      between funds being raised and the project(s) for which those funds are used.

It is much easier for a person to stand up and move forward when that person does not have to carry a heavy burden, whether it be financial, physical, psychological, or a combination of each. Unfortunately, our region is home to many communities whose environments stand as barriers to their desire for healthier, more resilient, and economically stable lives. Under-investment in communities of color has created structural barriers to success and new programs, like those around clean energy investments, have frequently passed over these places due to lack of understanding and capacity. In particular, communities of color are subject to environmental disparities, living in neighborhoods located close to densely congested highways or home to hazardous power plants, which has forced the communities to deal with these existing issues instead of on new opportunities and innovations. We believe that for all people to thrive, regardless of background, policies must eliminate these intrinsic barriers and be more cognizant of how we ensure all resident of the region can be prepared to meet the environmental challenges to come.
