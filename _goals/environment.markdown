- title: Enhance community resilience and sustainability to meet the present and future
    challenges
  text: We must make investments that strengthen communities by better preparing individuals
    and families to deal with natural hazards like floods and heat waves as well as
    meet the new challenges we expect from these natural events. We can build a more
    resilient region by making structural investments that foster community resiliency
    as well as positioning our residents to benefit from new technologies that are
    intended to increase economic and energy security.

  - title: Expand the Mass Solar Loan Program to more effectively reach low-income
      households that are “credit invisible” or have unscored credit records.
    text: "As of the close of 2017, the Mass Solar Loan Program is close to full utilization
      of the funding allocated to the program. Only 13% of Mass Solar Loan recipients
      had FICO scores equal to or lower than 680, and over 70% of the loans went to
      recipients with FICO scores over 720.[^46] People and communities of color have
      been targeted by predatory lenders and risky loan products, or are more likely
      to operate in an unscored economy. When a lending program is based solely on
      FICO scores, people of color are disenfranchised from taking advantage of the
      program. \n\nSolstice, a community solar provider, is currently researching
      and testing an alternative to FICO scores called an Energy Score, which takes
      into consideration utility payment performance, housing characteristics, financial
      characteristics, and demographic characteristics to establish a more inclusive
      and accurate prediction of whether or not an applicant is considered credit-worthy.[^47]
      A program of this kind could increase access for households that stand to benefit
      the most from participation in the Mass Solar Loan Program. The Mass Solar Program
      needs additional funding in order to expand this valuable program to more effectively
      support low-income households.\n\n[^46]: Mass Solar Loan. Program Performance,

  - title: Protect at-risk populations from current and future environmental hazards.
    text: The legislature is currently considering a proposal that would require that
      all residents who live in the Commonwealth have equal environmental justice,
      and all executive Secretariats develop policies and strategies to achieve environmental
      justice. This would include the appointment of a Director of Environmental Justice
      at the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs.  The proposal also
      creates a supplemental fund to support environmentally beneficial projects in
      low-income communities. The proposal is particularly important because we often
      see low-income communities living in climate-vulnerable locations. As superstorms
      and chemicals impact our municipalities, we have to make sure that all residents
      live somewhere they can expect to remain safe from climate hazards.

  - title: Provide a comprehensive energy efficiency program offering to effectively
      meet the needs of moderate-income customers and renters across the Commonwealth.
    text: The low-income energy efficiency program in Massachusetts is a leader in
      the clean energy field, but it is limited to serving households at or below
      60% of Area Median Income. The energy efficiency Program Administrators were
      instructed to roll out a moderate-income offer, but the impacts of this will
      be difficult to measure. We must continue to engage in robust advocacy to ensure
      that the needs of historically underserved populations are met by the state’s
      energy efficiency programs at the same time as we identify and approval additional
      program funding mechanisms, especially for moderate income customers.

  - title: Establish and fund a pilot program for shared electric vehicle services
      in Environmental Justice communities.
    text: Low-income families of color are less likely to own a vehicle than white
      and high-income families. Additionally, households in the lower third of the
      income range dedicate more of their household income to transportation costs
      than the upper third of the national income range. Providing shared mobility
      services with electric vehicles that have zero tail pipe emissions within environmental
      justice communities can potentially improve access to opportunity and improve
      local air quality through reduced emissions. The state will need to allocate
      significant new resources to support a successful program. Along with other
      New England states, Massachusetts is currently considering a regional cap and
      trade program for transportation-related emissions. If this passes, it could
      be a significant new source of funding available to reinvest in programs and
      initiatives designed to reduce emissions from the transportation sector.

      Just Transition is the practice of supporting vulnerable populations in the face of massive economic shifts both due to and to avoid climate change and loss of biodiversity. It is in response to the history of chaotic, harmful economic restructurings that have overwhelmingly affected low income communities of color. Just Transition ensures that the cost of these beneficial changes is not borne by a select few.

      Just Transition solutions are as diverse as the problem it hopes to solve. The Black Mesa Water Coalition in Arizona and their Just Transition Campaign is a leading example of community activism and involvement. The group has succeeded in shutting down polluting facilities and replacing them with clean community controlled sourced of energy and green economy jobs. In Boulder, Colorado the Just Transition Collaborative notes that non-homeowners lack the opportunity to invest in solar and may bear the brunt of shifts in utilities. The City of Boulder, per a recommendation of the Just Transition Collaborative, is designing a program to provide energy subsidies for the elderly, and low-income individuals, particularly low-income individuals of color.

- title: Eliminate food insecurity among families
  text: Families in our region are healthier when they do not have to worry if they
    will have access to nutritious foods. Unfortunately, many children and adults
    in the Metro Boston region do not have access to enough nutritious food to support
    an active and healthy life, and as a result we see many resulting health issues.
    We can reduce these health issues by focusing on eliminating food insecurity.
    Most importantly, we can see the greatest impact on equality of outcomes by focusing
    on those who experience insecurity and health related issues the most.
  policies:
  - title: Reduce the 'SNAP gap'
    text: The legislature is currently considering a proposal that would establish
      a common application for individuals who receive state benefits. It would allow
      those individuals who are eligible to simultaneously apply for the supplemental
      nutrition assistance program (SNAP) and other income support and benefit programs
      when the individual applies for or renews MassHealth coverage or other state
      application or renewal process. The legislation address the fact that an estimated
      680,000 people who are receiving MassHealth are likely also eligible for SNAP
      but are not currently enrolled.
    anchor: report-environment
  - title: Fund and expand the Healthy Incentives Program
    text: 'The statewide Healthy Incentives Program (HIP) was launched in April 2017,
      which will apply a one-dollar incentive on every SNAP benefit dollar spent on
      vegetables and fruits when purchased at four types of SNAP retailers selling
      locally-grown produce: farmers markets, farm stands, community supported agriculture
      programs, and mobile markets. It is modeled after a regional Massachusetts pilot
      which found that participants consumed over 25 percent more fruits and vegetables
      than did non-participants. The proposed bill would permanently establish an
      incentives program that would ensure sustainability of the current 3-year HIP
      and expand the types of SNAP retailers eligible to participate in the program. '

  - title: Support the Massachusetts Food Trust initiative
    text: 'The Massachusetts Food Trust Program, established in 2014, would provide
      loans, grants and technical assistance to support new and expanded healthy food
      retailers and local food enterprises in low- and moderate-income communities.
      This could include supermarkets, corner stores, farmer’s markets, mobile markets,
      community kitchens, food co-ops, food truck commissaries, indoor and outdoor
      greenhouses, and food distribution hubs. This private partnership program was
      a recommendation of the Grocery Access Task Force, a public-private partnership
      which met for about two years to tackle this problem. '

- title: Use economic incentives to reduce population health risks
  text: Our communities are stronger when families have fair access to services and
    products that are supportive and healthful. Unfortunately, what should be simple
    is frequently made difficult for certain populations, including people of color
    and families trapped in poverty. For example, food marketers target unhealthy
    foods to communities of color and to children,  and when these foods contribute
    to health issues like diabetes and hypertension, little community-based support
    is provided to help manage these conditions. As a result, we see health issues
    persist and those who already experience systemic challenges in their daily life
    have to shoulder additional burdens. We can change this by shifting where dollars
    come from and how we invest in the services that create pathways for people, especially
    those most at risk, to enjoy healthier lives.
  policies:
  - title: Tax soda and other sugary beverages
    text: 'The legislature is currently considering a proposal that would create a
      tiered excise tax on sugary drinks with rates based on the amount of added sugar
      each beverage contains. As the amount of sugar increases, the amount of tax
      would also increase. Sugary drink taxes have been successfully implemented across
      the country, generating significant new revenue that can be reinvested in a
      wide range of programs and creating a reduction in the overall consumption of
      sugary beverages. Researchers have estimated that an excise tax of a penny per
      ounce of sugar on sugar-sweetened beverages would prevent 45,900 cases of obesity
      by 2025, saving the Commonwealth $33.40 for every dollar invested in implementation
      of the bill. Revenue from a tiered excise tax could raise approximately $368
      million in the first year, and would decrease annually as consumption decreases.
      The revenue would be reinvested into public health initiatives, including access
      to clean and safe drinking water, the Prevention and Wellness Trust Fund, and
      other programs focused on children. '
    anchor: report-environment
  - title: Fund the Prevention and Wellness Trust Fund
    text: The Prevention and Wellness Trust Fund has increased access to preventative
      services for nearly one million people across the Commonwealth. The Fund does
      not rely on state funding, but is supported by a small assessment on health
      insurers. The program has been nationally recognized as a model because it has
      increased access to preventative services for nearly 1 million people across
      Massachusetts, including 22,000 students with asthma. Funding for the program
      ended in 2017.

    text: In November 2017, Governor Baker signed a law making contraception free
      to all Massachusetts women. The bill required Massachusetts health insurance
      companies to provide coverage for most contraceptive drugs, devices and products
      without requiring a copay. Research has long shown that contraception has significant
      health benefits for women because it can reduce the risk for ovarian and endometrial
      cancers, and it can treat conditions like endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome
      or uterine fibroids. On top of that, women with unintended pregnancies are more
      likely to receive delayed or no prenatal care. This legislation will make it
      easier for women to get the health care that they need and to take family planning
      decisions back into their own hands.

- title: Invest in programs that prevent harm and foster recovery
  text: Violence and addiction not only affect those directly involved, their effects
    ripple outward among family members and surrounding neighborhoods. In 2017, over
    1,000 Massachusetts residents died from opioid overdose.  In Boston, 16 teenagers
    were killed by guns, a figure that represents a doubling from the previous year.
    The causes of violent behavior and addition are complex. But, if we are going
    to offer any hope of turning the tide of these avoidable deaths, we must focus
    our efforts on prevention and recovery rather than condemnation and punishment.
  policies:
  - title: Increase funding for the Shannon Grant and the Safe and Successful Youth
      Initiative
    text: 'Since 2006, the Commonwealth has used the Senator Charles E. Shannon Grant
      to curb youth violence, gang violence and substance abuse through regional,
      multi-disciplinary efforts. Communication across municipal lines and coordination
      between public safety officers and social service agencies is what sets Shannon
      Grants apart from other efforts to fund local law enforcement prevention programs.
      The Safe and Successful Youth Initiative, implemented in 2011 after youth violence
      in Massachusetts was at an all-time high, combines public health and public
      safety approached to eliminating serious violence among high-risk urban youth.
      The program provides funding to support an intervention strategy that provides
      education, training and workforce development programs, as well as street outreach
      and trauma counseling. Funding programs that allow young people to create strong
      community relationships has a strong public health benefit for the youth in
      the program and for the communities where they live, providing a safe place
      for young people to go every day, with safe adults and mentors they can trust. '

  - title: Create better access to long-term treatment for people suffering from Substance
      Use Disorders
    text: Municipal service providers want to better connect individuals with Substance
      Use Disorders to immediate treatment options and offer a continuum of wrap-around
      services to support long-term recovery. Mechanisms to address this include the
      expansion of existing, successful programs to enhance recovery services and
      the development of new tools to support these vital connections. In order to
      create better access to long-term treatment, policy makers must identify successful
      programs that provide for both immediate treatment and long-term services, such
      as housing, food, transportation, or employment; profile successful programs
      and include lessons learned, ways to implement these in other communities, and
      opportunities for expanding these services on a regional or multi-community
      level; and initiate program partnership discussions and develop partnership
      proposals based on the program profile identified. Connecting people to appropriate
      recovery services as soon as possible after an incident/overdoes, such as medically-aided
      treatment and recovery coach monitoring programs, is considered vital to saving
      lives.

Our region is home to many communities whose environments stand as barriers to their desire for healthier, more resilient, and economically stable lives. Under-investment in communities of color has created structural barriers to success and new programs, like those around clean energy investments, have frequently passed over these places. In addition, communities of color are often subject to environmental disparities and public health, living in neighborhoods located close to densely congested highways or home to hazardous power plants, our without access to fresh fruits and vegetables. We must make policy changes that help all communities in Massachusetts meet existing environmental and public health challenges.
