    challenges
  text: We must make investments that strengthen communities by better preparing individuals
    and families to deal with natural hazards like floods and heat waves as well as
    meet the new challenges we expect from these natural events. We can build a more
    resilient region by making structural investments that foster community resiliency
    as well as positioning our residents to benefit from new technologies that are
    intended to increase economic and energy security.

  - title: Expand the Mass Solar Loan Program to more effectively reach low-income
      households that are “credit invisible” or have unscored credit records.
    text: "As of the close of 2017, the Mass Solar Loan Program is close to full utilization
      of the funding allocated to the program. Only 13% of Mass Solar Loan recipients
      had FICO scores equal to or lower than 680, and over 70% of the loans went to
      recipients with FICO scores over 720.[^46] People and communities of color have
      been targeted by predatory lenders and risky loan products, or are more likely
      to operate in an unscored economy. When a lending program is based solely on
      FICO scores, people of color are disenfranchised from taking advantage of the
      program. \n\nSolstice, a community solar provider, is currently researching
      and testing an alternative to FICO scores called an Energy Score, which takes
      into consideration utility payment performance, housing characteristics, financial
      characteristics, and demographic characteristics to establish a more inclusive
      and accurate prediction of whether or not an applicant is considered credit-worthy.[^47]
      A program of this kind could increase access for households that stand to benefit
      the most from participation in the Mass Solar Loan Program. The Mass Solar Program
      needs additional funding in order to expand this valuable program to more effectively
      support low-income households.\n\n[^46]: Mass Solar Loan. Program Performance,

  - title: Protect at-risk populations from current and future environmental hazards.
    text: "The Legislature is currently considering a proposal, An Act relative to
      environmental justice and toxics reduction in the Commonwealth, which would
      require all Executive Offices to develop policies and strategies to achieve
      environmental justice. This would include the appointment of a Director of Environmental
      Justice at the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs.[^49] \n\nThe
      proposal would also create a supplemental fund to support environmentally beneficial
      projects in low-income communities. The proposal is particularly important because
      we often see low-income communities living in climate-vulnerable locations.
      As superstorms and pollutants impact our municipalities, we have to make sure
      that all residents live somewhere they can expect to remain safe from current
      and predicted climate hazards.\n\n[^49]:In Massachusetts a community is recognized
      as an Environmental Justice community if any of the following are true: (1)
      Block group whose annual median household income is equal to or less than 65
      percent of the statewide median ($62,072 in 2010); or (2) 25% or more of the
      residents identifying as minority; or (3) 25% or more of households having no
      one over the age of 14 who speaks English only or very well - Limited English

  - title: Aim for elimination of indoor environmental hazards, beginning with those
      that directly affect children in our urban centers.
    text: Massachusetts has experienced tremendous progress overall in eliminating
      indoor environmental hazards such as lead and pests. The progress has not occurred
      evenly across the state or Metro Boston region as disparities still persist
      geographically and racially. A twofold approach can assist us in sustaining
      our progress so that we can eliminate exposures especially for children whose
      lives can be deeply affected by these hazards. One action is to increase funding
      for services to treat and eliminate indoor lead exposures for children. The
      second is to adequately fund the state’s Bureau of Environmental Health so that
      they have a sufficient number of staff and inspectors to monitor and address
      indoor pollutants in water, air, and materials that can lead to chronic health
      conditions and even cancer.

  - title: Provide a comprehensive energy efficiency program offering to meet the
      needs of moderate-income customers and renters across the Commonwealth.
    text: The Mass Save income-eligible program in Massachusetts is nationally recognized
      for its success, but it is currently limited to serving households at or below
      60% of Area Median Income, or about $62,000 for a family of four in the Metro
      Boston region. The Utility Energy Efficiency Program Administrators were directed
      by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities to provide a moderate-income
      offer in the 2016-2018 Three Year Energy Efficiency Plan and are rolling out
      a pilot in 2018. As Mass Save develops a new Three Year Plan we must  engage
      in robust advocacy to ensure that the state’s energy efficiency programs meet
      the needs of historically underserved populations and that appropriate resources
      are allocated to serve low income households, while at the same time identifying
      and approving additional program funding mechanisms, especially for moderate-income
      customers.

  - title: Establish and fund a pilot program for shared electric vehicle services
      in Environmental Justice communities.
    text: Lower-income families of color are less likely to own a vehicle than white
      and higher-income families. Additionally, households in the lower third of the
      income range dedicate more of their household income to transportation costs
      than the upper third of the national income range. Providing shared mobility
      services with electric vehicles that have zero tail pipe emissions within EJ
      communities could improve access to opportunity and improve local air quality
      through reduced emissions. The state would need to allocate significant new
      resources to support a successful program, which could be modeled after experimental
      programs that some municipalities are already trying. Along with other New England
      states, Massachusetts is currently considering a regional cap and trade program
      for transportation-related emissions. If this passes, it could be a significant
      new source of funding available to reinvest in programs and initiatives designed
      to reduce emissions from the transportation sector, including the one described
      here.

      fall most harshly on those who contributed the least to its causes, low-income
      communities and communities of color. As the climate changes, these populations
      will often be the first to face negative health outcomes, financial hardships,
      and social and cultural disruptions. Climate justice proponents seek to spread
      the burdens of climate change, as well as the benefits addressing climate change,

- title: Eliminate food insecurity among families
  text: Families in our region are healthier when they do not have to worry about
    access to nutritious foods. Unfortunately, many children and adults in the Metro
    Boston region do not have access to enough nutritious food to support an active
    and healthy life, and as a result we see many resulting health issues. We can
    reduce these health issues by focusing on eliminating food insecurity. Most importantly,
    we can see the greatest impact on equality of outcomes by focusing on those who
    experience insecurity and health related issues the most.
  policies:
  - title: Reduce the 'SNAP gap'
    text: 'The Legislature is currently considering a proposal that would establish
      a common application for individuals who receive state benefits. It would allow
      those individuals who are eligible to apply simultaneously for the Supplemental
      Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other income support and benefit programs,
      when the individual applies for or renews MassHealth coverage or other state
      application or renewal processes. The legislation address the fact that an estimated
      680,000 people who are receiving MassHealth are likely also eligible for SNAP
      but are not currently enrolled. '

  - title: Fund and expand the Healthy Incentives Program
    text: 'The statewide Healthy Incentives Program (HIP) was launched in April 2017,
      which will apply a one-dollar incentive on every SNAP benefit dollar spent on
      vegetables and fruits when purchased at four types of SNAP retailers selling
      locally-grown produce: farmers markets, farm stands, community supported agriculture
      programs, and mobile markets. It is modeled after a regional Massachusetts pilot
      which found that participants consumed over 25 percent more fruits and vegetables
      than did non-participants. The proposed bill would permanently establish an
      incentives program that would ensure sustainability of the current 3-year HIP
      and expand the types of SNAP retailers eligible to participate in the program. '

  - title: Support the Massachusetts Food Trust initiative
    text: The Massachusetts Food Trust Program, established in 2014, would provide
      loans, grants and technical assistance to support new and expanded healthy food
      retailers and local food enterprises in low- and moderate-income communities.
      This could include supermarkets, corner stores, farmers’ markets, mobile markets,
      community kitchens, food co-ops, food truck commissaries, indoor and outdoor
      greenhouses, and food distribution hubs. This private partnership program was
      a recommendation of the Grocery Access Task Force, a public-private partnership,
      which met for about two years to tackle this problem. Support for the program
      should include a launch of the program in the next year and sustained capital
      and operating funds for the program so that it achieves its intended statewide
      impact.

- title: Use economic incentives to reduce population health risks
  text: Our communities are stronger when families have fair access to services and
    products that are supportive and healthful. Unfortunately, what should be simple
    is frequently made difficult for certain populations, including people of color
    and families trapped in poverty. For example, food marketers target unhealthy
    foods to communities of color and to children,[^52] [^53] and when these foods
    contribute to health issues like diabetes and hypertension, little community-based
    support is provided to help manage these conditions. As a result, we see health
    issues persist and those who already experience systemic challenges in their daily
    life have to shoulder additional burdens. We can change this by shifting where
    dollars come from and how we invest in the services that create pathways for people,
    especially those most at risk, to enjoy healthier lives.
  policies:
  - title: Tax soda and other sugary beverages
    text: 'The Legislature is currently considering a proposal that would create a
      tiered excise tax on sugary drinks with rates based on the amount of added sugar
      each beverage contains. As the amount of sugar increases, the amount of tax
      would also increase. Sugary drink taxes have been successfully implemented across
      the country, generating significant new revenue that can be reinvested in a
      wide range of programs and creating a reduction in the overall consumption of
      sugary beverages. Researchers have estimated that an excise tax of a penny per
      ounce of sugar on sugar-sweetened beverages would prevent 45,900 cases of obesity
      by 2025, saving the Commonwealth $33.40 for every dollar invested in implementation
      of the bill.[^54] Revenue from a tiered excise tax could raise approximately
      $368 million in the first year,[^55] and would decrease annually as consumption
      decreases. The revenue would be reinvested into public health initiatives, including
      access to clean and safe drinking water, the Prevention and Wellness Trust Fund,
      and other programs focused on children. '
    anchor: report-environment
  - title: Fund the Prevention and Wellness Trust Fund
    text: The Prevention and Wellness Trust Fund (PWTF) has increased access to preventative
      services for nearly one million people across the Commonwealth. The Fund does
      not rely on state funding, but has been supported by a small assessment on health
      insurers. The program has been nationally recognized as a model because it has
      increased access to preventative services for nearly 1 million people across
      Massachusetts, including 22,000 students with asthma. Funding sunset for the
      program in 2017 – despite positive findings regarding improved outcomes and
      cost controls from the program evaluation – and new dedicated funding source
      was not approved. Without new resources, all PWTF partnerships will be eliminated
      by June 2018. The legislature must fund a new funding source for the program,
      which could include continuing the assessment on health insurers, or closing
      an existing tax loophole on flavored cigars and rededicating the funds to the
      PWTF.

    text: In November 2017, Governor Baker signed a law making contraception free
      to all Massachusetts women. The bill required Massachusetts health insurance
      companies to provide coverage for most contraceptive drugs, devices and products
      without requiring a copay. Research has long shown that contraception has significant
      health benefits for people with uteruses because it can reduce the risk for
      ovarian and endometrial cancers, and it can treat conditions like endometriosis,
      polycystic ovary syndrome or uterine fibroids.[^56] On top of that, women with
      unintended pregnancies are more likely to receive delayed or no prenatal care.
      This legislation will make it easier for women to get the health care that they
      need and to take family planning decisions back into their own hands.

- title: Invest in programs that prevent harm and foster recovery
  text: Violence and addiction not only affect those directly involved, but their
    effects also ripple outward among family members and surrounding neighborhoods.
    In 2017, over 1,000 Massachusetts residents died from opioid overdose. In Boston,
    16 teenagers were killed by guns, a figure that represents a doubling from the
    previous year. The causes of violent behavior and addition are complex. But, if
    we are going to offer any hope of turning the tide of these avoidable deaths,
    we must focus our efforts on prevention and recovery rather than condemnation
    and punishment.

    text: 'Since 2006, the Commonwealth has used the Senator Charles E. Shannon Grant
      to curb youth violence, gang violence and substance abuse through regional,
      multi-disciplinary efforts. Communication across municipal lines and coordination
      between public safety officers and social service agencies is what sets Shannon
      Grants apart from other efforts to fund local law enforcement prevention programs.
      The Safe and Successful Youth Initiative, implemented in 2011 after youth violence
      in Massachusetts was at an all-time high, combines public health and public
      safety approached to eliminating serious violence among high-risk urban youth.
      The program provides funding to support an intervention strategy that provides
      education, training and workforce development programs, as well as street outreach
      and trauma counseling. Funding programs that allow young people to create strong
      community relationships has a strong public health benefit for the youth in
      the program and for the communities where they live, providing a safe place
      for young people to go every day, with safe adults and mentors they can trust. '

  - title: Create better access to long-term treatment for people suffering from Substance
      Use Disorders
    text: Municipal service providers want to better connect individuals with Substance
      Use Disorders to immediate treatment options and offer a continuum of wrap-around
      services to support long-term recovery. Mechanisms to address this include the
      expansion of existing, successful programs to enhance recovery services and
      the development of new tools to support these vital connections. In order to
      create better access to long-term treatment, policy makers must identify successful
      programs that provide for both immediate treatment and long-term services, such
      as housing, food, transportation, or employment; profile successful programs
      and include lessons learned, ways to implement these in other communities, and
      opportunities for expanding these services on a regional or multi-community
      level; and initiate program partnership discussions and develop partnership
      proposals based on the program profile identified. Connecting people to appropriate
      recovery services as soon as possible after an incident/overdoes, such as medically-aided
      treatment and recovery coach monitoring programs, is considered vital to saving
      lives.

Our region is home to many communities whose environments stand as barriers to their desire for healthier, more resilient, and economically stable lives. Under-investment in communities of color has created structural barriers to success and new programs, like those around clean energy investments, have frequently passed over these places. In addition, communities of color are often subject to environmental disparities and public health, living in neighborhoods located close to densely congested highways or home to hazardous power plants, our without access to fresh fruits and vegetables. We must make policy changes that help all communities in Massachusetts meet existing environmental and public health challenges.
