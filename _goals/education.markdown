- title: Provide children with supportive learning environments from birth
  text: Research shows that children who start school ready to learn have better educational
    outcomes throughout primary school and are then able to achieve greater success
    in high school. Readiness to learn begins even before students enter elementary
    and secondary education as an infant’s health and environment is closely associated
    with the health and socioeconomic characteristics of its birth parents. It is
    linked as well with the health status of mothers who may be more prone to pre-term
    and low birth weight births when exposed to social and environmental stressors.
    Therefore, policy action can supply parents and children most in need with support
    from pregnancy through early childhood to improve lifelong outcomes.
  policies:
  - title: Increase funding for Head Start programs
    text: Our congressional delegation should build on their commitment to early education
      by increasing their support for the federally funded Head Start program.  Over
      the past fifty years, Head Start has provided comprehensive early education
      and support services in the areas of health and dental care, nutrition, special
      education, parent skill workshops and social services for children ages three
      to five and their families. We recommend that the increase in funding be dedicated
      not only to expanding access to the program to ensure that more children can
      benefit but also to develop and retain a quality workforce.

  - title: Pass legislation to fund Universal Pre-K
    text: Legislation has been filed to help close the achievement gap and ensure
      that all Massachusetts children have the opportunity to succeed in school and
      in life. The legislation builds on the Commonwealth’s strong policy foundation
      for early education, including the ongoing work of the Department of Elementary
      and Secondary Education (DESE). The legislation would capitalize on existing
      grant programs and might even help to reduce existing costs for special education
      and social services.

    text: The Harlem Children’s Zone (HCZ) is a cradle to college model serving thousands
      of youth in Harlem, NY. The organization offers a holistic approach, supporting
      their clients in educational advancement, family stabilization, housing security,
      healthy lifestyles, and social services. The HCZ seeks “to address the entire
      child and entire community of the child”  including fellow residents, stakeholders,
      and institutions.  The HCZ boasts a variety of programs for youth of all ages
      to participate in, from formal enrollment in Pre-K to High School to after school
      and enrichment programs. A Harvard Study in 2009 concluded that the HCZ’s Promise
      Academy and additional HCZ support programs had closed “the black-white achievement
      gap in mathematics and [reduced] it by nearly half in English Language Arts.”

- title: Ensure our institutional learning environments are safe and welcoming to
    all students no matter their income or race
  text: Our schools prepare children and adolescents for the future and we all lose
    out when our educational environments stunt, rather than foster growth. We continue
    to see outcomes that are unequal, as youth who are Black and Latino do not experience
    similar educational outcomes as their White peers. Disciplinary actions in school
    settings serve to push students of color away from our educational systems. We
    need to continue to push for those positive changes that expand support for all
    students so that differences in outcomes do not persist.
  policies:
  - title: End criminalization of disruptive behavior in schools
    text: The school-to-prison pipeline is a concept that describes repeated and escalating
      interactions of youth with school disciplinarians, the juvenile justice system,
      and the criminal justice system, ultimately leading to incarceration. Such interactions
      disproportionately affect students of color, low-income students, and special
      education students. Studies have shown that these students are not necessarily
      more prone to misbehavior than their peers; but policies and discrimination
      make them more likely be punished than White students. A proposed bill - An
      Act Decriminalizing Non-Violent and Verbal Student Misconduct - would help to
      dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline by limiting the use of criminal enforcement
      activities for nonviolent misconduct in schools, allowing the steps of arrest
      and prosecution only when other more appropriate school-based approaches have
      been tried and not succeeded.

  - title: Pass “Breakfast After the Bell” legislation
    text: 'Two out of three K-12 students that qualify for free and reduced lunch
      aren’t eating it. The stigma of the existing free breakfast programs and the
      logistical challenges of getting to school early keep students from participating
      in breakfast-before-the-bell programs. This bill requires that high poverty
      schools serve breakfast to all students at the beginning of the instructional
      day, or “after the bell.” Passage of this bill would extend existing benefits
      to over 260,000 students at approximately 600 Massachusetts schools. '

  - title: Address inequitable state funding formulas to increase support the state’s
      highest-need K-12 schools
    text: In 2015, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education changed the
      methodology used to count the number of low-income students and counted only
      those students that already participate in existing state benefit programs like
      SNAP, TAFDC, foster care or MassHealth. This change led to lower state funding
      to schools because it does not accurately capture the actual number of low-income
      students. This new method misses many students who are in the school system
      and are economically disadvantaged because it fails to account for those low-income
      students who are not accessing social services, which often include homeless
      youth and newly arrived immigrants. The current approach to counting low-income
      students leaves some of our most financially challenged communities with a significant
      financial gap. Adequate funding is critical to our communities and will ensure
      they receive the funding necessary to provide all students with education they
      deserve.

- title: "Make college accessible to all\t"
  text: A college degree continues to be associated with higher earnings and sustained
    labor force participation. We see increasingly that most job opportunities seek
    a minimum of a college degree from prospective job-seekers. Unfortunately, our
    region continues to see inequalities among those who have a bachelor’s degree
    or higher. We can make greater investments in opportunities for Black and Latino
    populations in order to close these gaps. We must create more routes to a college
    degree, especially for those whose income is limited or who are looking to move
    beyond mid-skill job opportunities.

  - title: Free tuition at community colleges
    text: |-
      Free tuition at community colleges for residents that have graduated high school or have completed their GEDs, would remove a barrier to individuals seeking to advance their career. Educational attainment is a strong indicator of how much money an individual will make and has long-term economic impacts as well. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median usual weekly earnings for someone with a high school diploma is $692, but for an Associate’s degree and Bachelor’s degree, is $892 and $1,156 respectively. The reverse trend is seen with unemployment rates, with higher unemployment rates correlating with lower educational attainment.
      In 2017, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh and Governor Charlie Baker rolled out the Boston Bridge, a continuation of Boston’s Tuition-Free Community College Plan. The Plan “pays for the costs of tuition and mandatory fees that are not covered by the Pell Grant” for low income city residents for up to three years of community college. The Boston Bridge is a pilot program that would allow these same students to then transfer into a four-year program through the state’s Commonwealth Commitment Program.
      California, Kentucky, Missouri, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee have all passed legislation or adopted pilot programs to provide some form of tuition free community college, while other states like Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, and South Dakota have free tuition at community colleges for targeted fields of study.

  - title: In-state tuition for undocumented youth
    text: According to the Pew Research Center, there are 210,000 undocumented immigrants
      in Massachusetts, including over 8,000 DACA recipients. DACA, Deferred Action
      for Childhood Arrival, was created in June 2012 by President Obama and enabled
      undocumented individuals brought to the U.S. as children to receive Social Security
      numbers, temporary work permits, and protection from deportation, as long as
      they met age requirements, demonstrated physical presence, met educational or
      military service requirements, and passed a criminal background check. In 2012,
      Governor Patrick took Executive Action that allowed DACA recipients to be eligible
      for in-state tuition at the 29 public colleges and universities, as long as
      they met the Board of Higher Education’s residency requirements. While this
      is still the current policy in Massachusetts, recent federal actions require
      that the Commonwealth pass legislation to extend in-state tuition at public
      higher education institutions to current DACA recipients and allow other undocumented
      immigrants who are not DACA eligible to enroll in college as in-state students.
      Full implementation of in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants could result
      in an additional $7 million of annual revenue to the public university system.

    text: "First generation college students, particularly first generation college
      students from communities of color, face emotional, lifestyle, and financial
      barriers on their path to graduation. As a result many aspiring college students
      either turn down acceptances or matriculate and quickly drop out. Wraparound
      support services for students from underrepresented populations seek to address
      these poor outcomes. A student in wraparound services receives case management
      services, housing assistance, academic and career support, and solutions to
      basic needs. \n\nOne example is Florida State University’s Unconquered Scholars
      Program that serves youth experiencing foster care, homelessness, and relative
      care. The US Program enrolled its first cohort in 2012 and as of 2016 participants
      had a 91% retention rate and a 3.01 grade point average. \n\n"

In Massachusetts, we place a high value on learning and education. We have prospered due to our high levels of educational performance and public and private academic institutions. While many have benefited from the lifelong learning opportunities found in our region, not all do—[statistics about Black and Latino educational attainment gaps and/or Black, Latino, ELL, and children with disabilities MCAS gaps]. Consequently, we have set [these] children, teenagers, and adults on a path that narrows their chances to reach their full potential and that perpetuates inequalities in our region. Since [a person with a college degree is X times more likely to be employed and is likely to make X more money annually, than the same person without a college degree] earnings and economic independence are highly related to educational attainment, we limit their prosperity and a substantial return on investment to the region. There is a considerable amount of work and change necessary to provide quality learning opportunities for the people who are in most need and facing the greatest disparities.
