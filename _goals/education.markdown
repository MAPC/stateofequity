- title: Provide children with supportive learning environments from birth
  text: Research shows that children who start school ready to learn have better educational
    outcomes throughout primary school and are then able to achieve greater success
    in high school. Readiness to learn begins even before students enter elementary
    education as an infant’s health and environment is closely associated with the
    health and socioeconomic characteristics of their birth parents. It is linked
    as well with the health status of mothers who may be more prone to pre-term and
    low birth weight births when exposed to social and environmental stressors. Therefore,
    policy action can supply parents and children most in need with support from pregnancy
    through early childhood to improve lifelong outcomes.
  policies:
  - title: Increase funding for Head Start programs
    text: Our congressional delegation should build on their commitment to early education
      by increasing their support for the federally funded Head Start program. Over
      the past 50 years, Head Start has provided comprehensive early education and
      support services in the areas of health and dental care, nutrition, special
      education, parent skill workshops and social services for children ages three
      to five and their families. We recommend an increase in funding not only so
      more children can benefit, but also to develop and retain a quality workforce.

  - title: Pass legislation to fund Universal Pre-K
    text: Legislation has been filed to help close the achievement gap and ensure
      that all Massachusetts children have the opportunity to succeed in school and
      in life. The legislation builds on the Commonwealth’s strong policy foundation
      for early education, including the ongoing work of the Department of Elementary
      and Secondary Education (DESE). Cost estimates range anywhere from $400 million
      to $1.4 billion, depending on the type of universal pre-K program the state
      seeks to implement, and whether it covers 3- and 4-year-olds or only 4-year-olds.
      The pending proposal would capitalize on existing grant programs and many advocates
      argue that it would actually help to reduce existing costs for special education
      and social services, pointing to successful programs in Boston, New Jersey,
      and Oklahoma.

      The Harlem Children’s Zone (HCZ) is a cradle to college model serving thousands of youth in Harlem, NY. The organization offers a holistic approach, supporting their clients in educational advancement, family stabilization, housing security, healthy lifestyles, and social services. The HCZ seeks “to address the entire child and entire community of the child”[^37]  including fellow residents, stakeholders, and institutions.  The HCZ boasts a variety of programs for youth of all ages to participate in, from formal enrollment in Pre-K to High School to after school and enrichment programs. A Harvard Study in 2009 concluded that the HCZ’s Promise Academy and additional HCZ support programs had closed “the black-white achievement gap in mathematics and [reduced] it by nearly half in English Language Arts.”[^38]

- title: Ensure our institutional learning environments are safe, welcoming and culturally
    and linguistically sustaining for all students.
  text: Our schools prepare children and adolescents for the future and we all lose
    out when our educational environments stunt, rather than foster growth. We continue
    to see outcomes that are unequal, as youth who are Black and Latino do not experience
    similar educational outcomes as their White peers. Disciplinary actions in school
    settings serve to push students of color away from our educational systems. We
    need to continue to push for those positive changes that expand support for all
    students so that differences in outcomes do not persist.
  policies:
  - title: End criminalization of disruptive behavior in schools
    text: |-
      The school-to-prison pipeline[^39] is a concept that describes repeated and escalating interactions of youth with school disciplinarians, the juvenile justice system, and the criminal justice system, ultimately leading to incarceration. Such interactions disproportionately criminalize the behavior of students of color, low-income students, and special education students at higher rates than their White counterparts for the same behaviors. Studies have shown that these students are not necessarily more prone to misbehavior than their peers; but policies and discrimination make them more likely be punished than White students.[^40]

      A proposed bill - An Act Decriminalizing Non-Violent and Verbal Student Misconduct - would help to dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline by limiting the use of criminal enforcement activities for nonviolent misconduct in schools, allowing the steps of arrest and prosecution only when other more appropriate school-based approaches have been tried and not succeeded. In addition, the expansion of alternative programs that address root causes of off-track behavior and apply restorative justice practices are essential next steps.

  - title: Pass “Breakfast After the Bell” legislation
    text: Two out of three K-12 students that qualify for free and reduced lunch aren’t
      eating it. The stigma of the existing free breakfast programs and the logistical
      challenges of getting to school early keep students from participating in breakfast-before-the-bell
      programs. This bill requires that high poverty schools serve breakfast to all
      students at the beginning of the instructional day, or “after the bell.” Passage
      of this bill would extend existing benefits to over 260,000 students at approximately
      600 Massachusetts schools.

  - title: Address inequitable state funding formulas to increase support the state’s
      highest-need K-12 schools
    text: In 2015, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education changed the
      methodology used to count the number of low-income students and counted only
      those students that already participate in existing state benefit programs like
      Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Transitional Aid to Families
      with Dependent Children (TAFDC), foster care, or MassHealth. This change led
      to lower state funding to schools because it does not accurately capture the
      actual number of low-income students. This new method misses many students who
      are economically disadvantaged because it fails to account for those low-income
      students who are not accessing social services, such as homeless youth and newly
      arrived immigrants. The current approach to counting low-income students leaves
      some of our most financially challenged communities with a significant financial
      gap. Adequate funding is critical to our communities and will ensure they receive
      the funding necessary to provide all students with education they deserve.

  - title: Expand the funding and reach of METCO.
    text: The Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity (METCO) program, created
      in 1966, is the longest continuously running voluntary school desegregation
      program in the country. The program provides voluntary busing for eligible high
      school students between Boston or Springfield and their suburbs. It was created
      to expand educational opportunities, increase diversity, and reduce racial isolation,
      by permitting students in certain cities to attend public schools in other communities
      that have agreed to participate. The program should be modernized to serve today’s
      educational needs and should expand both its funding and reach in order to increase
      the number of students and suburban municipalities that participate. This would
      help provide access for more students to many high-quality schools in the suburbs.

- title: "Make college accessible to all\t"
  text: A college degree continues to be associated with higher earnings and sustained
    labor force participation. We see increasingly that most job opportunities seek
    a minimum of a college degree from prospective job seekers. Unfortunately, our
    region continues to see inequalities among those who have a bachelor’s degree
    or higher. We can make greater investments in opportunities for low-income populations
    and Black and Latino populations in order to close these gaps. We must create
    more routes to a college degree, especially for those who are looking to move
    beyond mid-skill job opportunities.
  policies:
  - title: Implement free tuition at community colleges.
    text: |-
      Free tuition at community colleges for residents who have graduated high school or have completed their GEDs, would remove a barrier to individuals seeking to advance their career. Educational attainment is a strong indicator of how much money an individual will make and has long-term economic impacts as well. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median usual weekly earnings for someone with a high school diploma is $692, but for an Associate’s degree and Bachelor’s degree, is $892 and $1,156 respectively.[^41] The reverse trend is seen with unemployment rates, with higher unemployment rates correlating with lower educational attainment.
      In 2017, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh and Governor Charlie Baker rolled out the Boston Bridge, a continuation of Boston’s Tuition-Free Community College Plan. The Plan “pays for the costs of tuition and mandatory fees that are not covered by the Pell Grant”[^42] for low income city residents for up to three years of community college. The Boston Bridge is a pilot program that would allow these same students to then transfer into a four-year program through the state’s Commonwealth Commitment Program.

      California, Kentucky, Missouri, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee have all passed legislation or adopted pilot programs to provide some form of tuition free community college, while other states like Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, and South Dakota have free tuition at community colleges for targeted fields of study.

  - title: Allow undocumented youth to pay in-state tuition at state colleges and
      universities.
    text: |-
      According to the Pew Research Center, there are 210,000 undocumented immigrants in Massachusetts, including over 8,000 DACA recipients.[^43] DACA, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival, was created in June 2012 by President Obama and enabled undocumented individuals brought to the U.S. as children to receive Social Security numbers, temporary work permits, and protection from deportation, as long as they met age requirements, demonstrated physical presence, met educational or military service requirements, and passed a criminal background check. In 2012, Governor Patrick took Executive Action that allowed DACA recipients to be eligible for in-state tuition at the 29 public colleges and universities, as long as they met the Board of Higher Education’s residency requirements. While this is still the current policy in Massachusetts, recent federal actions require that the Commonwealth pass legislation to extend in-state tuition at public higher education institutions to current DACA recipients and allow other undocumented immigrants who are not DACA eligible to enroll in college as in-state students. Full implementation of in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants could result in an additional $7 million of annual revenue to the public university system.[^44]

    text: In several states, school districts are collaborating with area community
      colleges to offer a combination of high school and community college courses.
      The programs use local school district funds that would have supported the student
      in the district to cover the students cost in attending the community college,
      which typically equates to a reduced or free tuition for the college courses.
      The programs have been used to create a better transition to higher education
      for those who have met their high school educational requirements but face challenges
      in affording or accessing a college setting. Examples include the City of Eugene's
      (OR) Advanced Career Technical (A.C.T.) program and the City of Austin’s (TX)
      Early College High School program.

In Massachusetts, we place a high value on learning and education. We have prospered in large part due to our high levels of educational performance and public and private academic institutions. While many have benefited from the lifelong learning opportunities found in our region, not all do. Many of our students of color, students with disabilities, and students from low-income households face challenges in meeting educational achievement goals and graduating from high school. Consequently, we have set these children, teenagers, and adults on a path that narrows their chances to reach their full potential and that perpetuates inequalities in our region. Since a person with a college degree has a much greater chance of being employed and be compensated nearly double the amount as a person without a college degree,[^36] earnings and economic independence are highly related to educational attainment, we limit their prosperity and a substantial return on investment to the region. There is a considerable amount of work and change necessary to provide quality learning opportunities for people who are in most need and facing the greatest disparities.
