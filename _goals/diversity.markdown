strategies:
- title: Protect tenants, increase the supply of homes that low-and middle-income
    families can afford to buy, and help all residents stay where they live.
  text: The lack of affordable housing options in Metro Boston negatively impacts
    the region’s ability to house our economically and ethnically diverse residential
    base and to support a thriving economy. Half the region’s renters and 30% of homeowners
    are cost burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their annual household
    income on housing. Policy responses to the affordability crisis include preserving
    the existing affordable housing supply, increasing the stock of housing, both
    affordable and market rate, and ensuring that below market-rate units are occupied
    by households with corresponding incomes. Special attention must be paid to ensuring
    that adequate and affordable housing is available for families with children,
    seniors downsizing from larger homes, and people with disabilities – all populations
    that historically have limited housing choices.
  policies:
  - title: Pass comprehensive zoning reform in order to encourage affordable housing
      production and eliminate discriminatory zoning practices.
    text: |2-

      Massachusetts has a long history of residential segregation, which can be traced in large part to restrictive local zoning and permitting decisions, as well as discriminatory real estate and lending practices. Comprehensive zoning reform in Massachusetts must promote inclusive neighborhoods where families with children and households with low-or-moderate incomes can find homes.

      Massachusetts has not comprehensively updated its core zoning and subdivision laws in several decades. Municipalities across the Commonwealth use existing zoning laws as a way to prevent changes that would allow more affordable homes, condominiums, and apartments. An update to the Commonwealth’s outdated zoning laws should ensure that most cities and towns will allow at least some districts where multi-family housing can be built, while encouraging municipalities to adopt bylaws or ordinances that ensure at least a portion of this housing will be deed-restricted affordable. Both of these tools will help to increase housing type diversity and affordability in Metro Boston and across the Commonwealth.

  - title: Provide additional funds for preservation and production of affordable
      homes and continue to fund existing smart-growth incentive zoning.
    text: To meaningfully address our state’s housing crisis, we have to dedicate
      greater resources to preserving and producing affordable homes. Some particularly
      important elements of our housing production system include adequate funding
      for the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, the
      Housing Innovation Fund, and the Massachusetts Rental Voucher Program. Adequate
      funds for the modernization of public housing are essential. The state should
      continue to fund the Commonwealth’s smart growth incentive programs under Chapters
      40R and 40S, so that cities and towns can implement smart growth zoning overlays
      and feel confident that when they do, any possible impacts on school capacity
      will be meaningfully offset by state funding.[^9]

  - title: Pass legislation aimed at increasing protections for renters.
    text: "Legislation that would give tenants a right to counsel in eviction proceedings,
      require just-cause evictions, protect paying tenants when a home is foreclosed
      or sold for a tax lien, and offer tenants the right of first refusal in the
      event that their property is sold are modest steps that would help reduce housing
      insecurity. When tenants are defended by counsel in court proceedings, they
      are more likely to remain in their homes. Just-cause eviction laws protect tenants
      from unfair or discriminatory evictions, while a right of first refusal would
      give tenants an opportunity to purchase or assign their right to purchase a
      property, thereby increasing housing stability. \nAdditionally, we should pass
      legislation that would give a tax credit to landlords who rent at below-market
      rates, helping to incentivize these landlords to maintain rents that are affordable,
      especially for low- and moderate-income tenants, and to protect neighborhoods
      from the effects of inflation. Also, tenants generally lack any protection against
      eviction when the home in which they are living is foreclosed, or when a municipality
      sells the property for tax collection – even if the tenant is up to date on
      her rent. Protections in such instances are essential ways for the tenant’s
      housing circumstances to remain stable, even if the underlying property is undergoing
      a change of ownership."

  - title: Facilitate affordable housing production for a range of low-income households.
    text: Currently, most affordable housing requirements are aimed at households
      with incomes at 80% of the area median or below. As a result, the majority of
      new units are affordable to households with incomes closest to that ceiling.
      The area median income (AMI) for a four-person household in the metropolitan
      statistical area (MSA) for Metro Boston is $103,400. The MSA is an area so geographically
      large that it includes municipalities in Middlesex, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex
      and Plymouth Counties, and even parts of New Hampshire. High wealth suburbs
      in the MSA drive up our region’s AMI, which ultimately means that most deed-restricted
      affordable units are not actually within financial reach of many in need in
      Metro Boston. Moreover, very low-income (30-50% of AMI) and extremely low-income
      (30% of AMI and below) working households are growing in number and as a share
      of the region’s population. To address the increasing need within the context
      of an elevated AMI, affordable housing requirements should be adjusted to include
      a portion of homes for those with incomes between 50% and 80% of the AMI, between
      30% and 50%, and even 30% and below.
  best_practice:
    text: Housing First is an approach that provided immediate access to permanent
      housing for individuals and families who are experiencing homelessness. By contrast
      to approaches that seek to graduate people who are homeless through short-term
      housing and treatment, the Housing First approach provides permanent housing
      with out preconditions and includes supportive services (e.g., medication management,
      counseling). Research has provided strong evidence that the combination of immediate
      access to permanent housing and to supportive services has reduced homelessness.[^11]
      In addition, there is strong evidence that the approach reduces hospitalizations
      for those who are homeless and have mental illnesses and substance use disorders.
      Currently, both public sector agencies and hospital systems are making investments
      into housing stability using the Housing First approach as model. Examples include
      Housing First Initiative Programs run by the Homeless Services Bureau of the
      Boston Public Health Commission[^12] and the housing-focused Community Health
      Initiative of Boston Medical Center.[^13]

- title: Ensure residents with low incomes, people of color, and other protected classes
    have access to homes that suit their needs.
  text: Discriminatory practices still limit homeownership. For instance, high-income
    applicants who are Black or Latino are denied a mortgage at rates that are 7-to-12
    percentage points higher than applicants who are white and of similar economic
    status. Since homeownership gaps play a key role in the nation’s widening racial
    wealth gap,[^14] the racial disparities in Metro Boston homeownership rates and
    home loan denial rates are limiting the capacity of Metro Boston residents of
    color and their municipalities to build wealth.
  policies:
  - title: Continue to enforce the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule.
    text: The rule, promulgated under the Obama administration, required that jurisdictions
      that receive federal housing funding not only document barriers to integration
      and opportunity, but also detail and prioritize policies to eradicate these
      barriers. The Trump Administration has delayed implementation of this rule,
      and indicated they have no intention to read any plans currently submitted until
      2020. But the main purpose of these plans – to help local governments to understand
      and eliminate discriminatory practices – remains as important as ever. At the
      local level, cities and towns should continue moving forward to develop Assessments
      of Fair Housing, and MAPC will continue to assist them both to develop these
      plans and to implement their recommendations.

  - title: Prioritize housing stock diversity across Massachusetts communities.
    text: Across our region, small single-family homes are being torn down and replaced
      with larger, more expansive single-family properties. The new homes are generally
      higher priced and are not viable options for low- and moderate-income would-be
      homeowners. At the same time, developers of new, multi-family residential developments
      often disregard guidelines that encourage a bedroom mix inclusive of 3-bedroom
      units, instead opting to build studio, one- and two-bedroom units, which limits
      opportunities for displaced families seeking homes in gentrifying  neighborhoods.
      Local legislative action should request that a range of home sizes be provided
      through redevelopment or limit replacement to similar footprints. These actions
      may help minimize the impact of teardowns on neighborhoods. In addition, municipalities
      should encourage development of smaller single-family homes, multi-family units
      in smart growth locations and the opportunity for accessory dwelling units (ADUs)
      that make homes more accessible, especially to those with limited incomes, aging
      residents, and people with disabilities.
  best_practice:
    text: "Planning processes should include significant community engagement and
      outreach to include participation from older adults, persons with disabilities,
      people of color, immigrants, people for whom English is not their primary language,
      and women.\n \nFor example, equitable community engagement was a critical component
      of efforts to build on the Vision for Downtown Lynn. MAPC partnered with the
      city of Lynn to convene a project team of advisors, conducted interviews with
      community leaders, gave presentations to community-based organizations, attended
      community events, talked with people we encountered on the street or at local
      businesses, interacted with community members using social media such as Facebook
      as well as via email, collected land use and property data using local volunteers,
      and hosted two public forums downtown. It is often unfeasible to get input from
      every single resident, but this targeted approach provided an informed perspective
      to guide planning recommendations.\n"

- title: 'Ensure that our communities are inclusive, representative and democratic '
  text: In order for residents living in Metro Boston to thrive and contribute to
    their fullest, they must feel a sense of inclusivity, belonging, and control.
    Voting must continue to be a right, preserved by removing barriers to voter registration
    that could limit turnout or participation. Voting rights could even be extended
    so that every resident of an area, regardless of citizenship status, could participate
    in local elections. Beyond voting, current immigration policies often prevent
    undocumented residents from meaningfully participating in regular civic processes.
    Yet undocumented immigrants produce incredible value for the region. If undocumented
    immigrants were deported, the region would face severe financial impacts; one
    estimate suggests Massachusetts would lose approximately $12 billion in economic
    activity and over 55,000 jobs. On the other hand, a more recent study estimates
    that securing lawful permanent residence for undocumented immigrants would generate
    over $259 million in state and local taxes, on top of the taxes that undocumented
    immigrants already pay. Undocumented residents should be given protections to
    remain in the Commonwealth.
  policies:
  - title: Enact automatic voter registration throughout Massachusetts
    text: Automatic voter registration enables a government agency, usually the Registry
      of Motor Vehicles, to automatically register a citizen upon state license or
      ID issuance or renewal, unless the person declines to do so. The citizen’s information
      is then sent to the appropriate election office for verification of voting eligibility.
      Currently, nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted automatic voter
      registration policies, as they serve to increase voter registration rates and
      help to eliminate existing barriers to voter registration.

  - title: Make Massachusetts a sanctuary state
    text: 'Sanctuary state legislation would prohibit state and local resources from
      being used to enforce federal immigration laws and would prevent law enforcement
      officers from inquiring about an individual’s immigration status unless it is
      pertinent to the crime at issue. The legislation would further limit Immigration,
      Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents from accessing information on booking lists
      or release dates unless a person is serving a sentence for a serious violent
      felony. Ensuring that our communities remain welcoming to all residents, regardless
      of where they come from or the circumstances of their arrival, is important
      to the long-term economic and social wellbeing of the entire Commonwealth. '
    anchor: diversity-agenda
  - title: Create a process that allows non-citizen immigrants to vote in municipal
      elections
    text: 'Across the country, several municipalities or counties have allowed non-citizen
      residents to vote in municipal elections, under the theory that all residents
      should be involved in municipal service delivery. Historically, until 1926,
      40 states allowed non-citizens to vote in municipal and state elections, a policy
      that was reversed as nativist sentiments rose in the United States. '
    anchor: diversity-agenda
  - title: Cultivate competency for service provision to residents who are lesbian,
      gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer
    text: As a just and fair society, we seek and use approaches that allow for greater
      inclusion. In Metro Boston and Massachusetts, there are policy actions that
      can foster greater inclusion and responsiveness to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
      and queer (LGBTQ) residents. This includes partnering with representatives of
      the LGBTQ to build capacity in public and private service providers for greater
      cultural competency. An example of such a proposal is the An Act Relative to
      LGBT Awareness Training for Aging Services Provider, which would support development
      of a training program for the delivery of accessible and appropriate services
      to LGBTQ older adults and their caregivers. This act would prevent older LGBTQ
      residents from any need to hide their identity and receive care that is relevant
      and respectful.

    text: "Cities and towns across the country offer training to municipal employees
      to learn how to engage with undocumented residents and with government agencies
      like the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. In Portland, Oregon the
      Human Resources Bureau, along with the Office of Equity and Human Rights and
      they City Attorney’s office developed a plan for training city workers how to
      respond to federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. \n"

Metro Boston neighborhoods are becoming more economically segregated and racial desegregation lags significantly behind other metropolitan regions. The principle drivers of these trends are high housing prices, income disparities, and discriminatory lending and renting practices. Our current population and housing demand projections estimate that Metro Boston needs to build 435,000 units of housing – mostly multifamily – between 2010 and 2040 to meet increasing demand and maintain current affordability. Unfortunately, we are falling far short, meaning that our region is becoming increasingly unaffordable for families. Families are increasingly cost-burdened in our region, spending well over 30% of their income on housing.[^8] 

Since 2012, the rate of cost burden has been trending up for the renter population and down for the homeowner population. The trend indicates a growing housing cost burden gap between homeowners and renters, increasing the vulnerability of the region’s renters who are disproportionately people of color. Neighborhoods with a high concentration of cost-burdened residents, especially renters, are at risk of rapid population turnover when housing costs rise even slightly or when these households face economic setbacks. Tempering the rising cost of housing will be a critical step in ensuring that the earnings of Metro Boston residents are sufficient to enable them to make a home and remain financially stable. Of course, housing costs are only one side of the equation; job opportunities and growing wages are also essential, as discuss further below. 
At the same time, policies that encourage affordability do not necessarily promote inclusiveness. As neighborhoods change – physically, economically, socially – we can take steps that protect diversity and create welcoming environments. Likewise, places can grow stronger and more resilient by accommodating people with a mixture of unique perspectives and experiences. Integrating new people while honoring those who have been part of a place history does require intention. Policies provide a framework for how the state and cities and towns can manage a changing environment while providing an opportunity for all to benefit from inclusiveness.
