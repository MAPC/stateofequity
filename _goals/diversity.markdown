'
  text: The lack of affordable housing options in Metro Boston negatively impacts
    the region’s ability to house our economically and ethnically the workforce and
    diverse residential base more broadly, and to support a thriving economy. Half
    the region’s renters and 30% of homeowners are cost burdened, meaning they spend
    more than 30% of their annual household income on housing. Policy responses to
    the affordability crisis include preserving the existing affordable housing supply,
    increasing the stock of housing, both affordable and market rate, and ensuring
    that below market-rate units are occupied by households with corresponding incomes.
  policies:
  - title: Pass comprehensive zoning reform in order to encourage affordable housing
      production and eliminate discriminatory zoning practices.
    text: "Massachusetts has not updated its zoning laws in over 40 years. Municipalities
      across the Commonwealth use existing zoning laws as a way to stop development
      opportunitiesprevent changes that would provide allow more affordable homes,
      condominiums, and multifamily housingapartments. An update to the Commonwealth’s
      outdated zoning laws should require municipalities cities and towns to create
      neighborhoods of more affordable homes zone for multifamily housing and should
      encourage municipalities to adopt inclusionary zoning bylaws or ordinances that
      require private developers to contribute when they are building market rate
      or luxury housing. Both of these tools will help to increase housing affordabilityle
      housing opportunities in Metro Boston and across the Commonwealth.  \nMassachusetts
      has a long history of residential segregation, which can be traced to restrictive
      local zoning and permitting decisions. Comprehensive zoning reform in Massachusetts
      must promote inclusive neighborhoods where housing opportunities for families
      with children and those with low- and moderate-incomes can find homes just as
      easily as those with more wealth or no dependents households.\nProvide additional
      funds for preservation and production of affordable housing homes and to continue
      to fund existing smart-growth incentive zoning.\nAs federal funding for affordable
      housing becomes uncertain, tThe state should earmark fundingmake financial investments
      to that support municipalities with both production and preservation targets
      related to housing affordability. The state should also continue to fund the
      Commonwealth’s smart growth incentive programs under Chapters 40R and 40S so
      that municipalities cities and towns can feel confident that when they implement
      smart growth zoning overlays, any possible impacts on school capacity will be
      meaningfully offset by state funding."

  - title: Pass legislation aimed at increasing protections for renters.
    text: "Legislation that would give all tenants a right to counsel in eviction
      proceedings, require just-cause evictions, and offer tenants the right of first
      refusal in the event that their property is sold will help to increase housing
      stabilityreduce housing insecurity. When tenants are protected in court proceedings,
      they are more likely to remain in their homes. Just-cause eviction laws protect
      tenants from unfair or discriminatory evictions, while a right of first refusal
      would give tenants an opportunity to purchase or assign their right to purchase
      a property, thereby increasing the likelihood that the affordable property home
      remains affordableavailable in the community. Additionally, we should pass legislation
      that would give an income tax credit to landlords that rent at below-market
      rates, helping to incentivize these landlords to maintain rents that are affordable,
      especially for thosetenants whose wages have not increased,  rates and to protect
      neighborhoods from the effects of gentrification. \nDetermine affordability
      based on median income for by municipality\nCurrently, affordable housing eligibility
      is based on area median income (AMI) for the metropolitan statistical area (MSA).
      For Greater Boston, the MSA is geographically a large area thatand includes
      municipalities in Middlesex, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Plymouth Counties (,
      and even parts of New Hampshire). Wealthy suburbs in this MSA drive up our median
      income, which ultimately means that most homes that much of the deed-restricted
      as affordable housing is are not actually affordable within financial reach
      of many of those who live in Greater Boston communities. Determining affordability
      based on local median income will ensure that deed-restricted housing is available
      for those who need it most."

  text: Our analysis shows that the region’s commuters of color often spend longer
    commuting than their White counterparts. Without a range of convenient transportation

Metro Boston neighborhoods are becoming more economically segregated and racial desegregation lags significantly behind other metropolitan regions. The principle drivers of these trends are incredibly high housing prices, significant income disparities, and discriminatory lending and renting practices. Our current population and housing demand projections anticipate estimate that Metro Boston needs to build 329,000 units of housing – mostly multifamily – between 2010 and 2030 to meet increasing demand and improve maintain current affordability. Unfortunately, we are falling far short, meaning that our region is becoming increasingly unaffordable for families. Families are increasingly cost-burdened in our region, spending well over 30% of their income on housing. 

Since 2012 the rate of cost burden has been trending up for the renter population and down for the homeowner population. The trend, indicate a growing housing cost burden gap between homeowners and renters, and underscoring increasing the vulnerability of the region’s renters who are disproportionately people of color. Neighborhoods with a high concentration of cost-burdened residents, especially renters, are at risk of rapid population turnover when housing costs rise slightly or when these households face economic setbacks. Tempering the rising cost of living will be a critical step in ensuring that all Metro Boston residents’ earnings are  can have enough income to make a home and remain financially stable. 

At the same time, policies that encourage diversity do not necessarily promote inclusiveness. Immigrants, both documented and undocumented, are a critical component of Metro Boston’s economy and culture. Policies that exclude and ostracize immigrants reduce opportunities for them to engage civically, limiting the region’s progress and ability to thrive. New punitive federal immigration policies puts the onus on local governments to enact and enforce policies that make immigrants feel safe and that encourages them to engage with the people and placesd around them.
