'
  text: The lack of affordable housing options in Metro Boston negatively impacts
    the region’s ability to house our economically and ethnically the workforce and
    diverse residential base more broadly, and to support a thriving economy. Half
    the region’s renters and 30% of homeowners are cost burdened, meaning they spend
    more than 30% of their annual household income on housing. Policy responses to
    the affordability crisis include preserving the existing affordable housing supply,
    increasing the stock of housing, both affordable and market rate, and ensuring
    that below market-rate units are occupied by households with corresponding incomes.
  policies:
  - title: Pass comprehensive zoning reform in order to encourage affordable housing
      production and eliminate discriminatory zoning practices.
    text: "Massachusetts has not updated its zoning laws in over 40 years. Municipalities
      across the Commonwealth use existing zoning laws as a way to stop development
      opportunities prevent changes that would provide allow more affordable homes,
      condominiums, and multifamily housing apartments. An update to the Commonwealth’s
      outdated zoning laws should require municipalities cities and towns to create
      neighborhoods of more affordable homes zone for multifamily housing and should
      encourage municipalities to adopt inclusionary zoning bylaws or ordinances that
      require private developers to contribute when they are building market rate
      or luxury housing. Both of these tools will help to increase housing affordabilityle
      housing opportunities in Metro Boston and across the Commonwealth.  \nMassachusetts
      has a long history of residential segregation, which can be traced to restrictive
      local zoning and permitting decisions. Comprehensive zoning reform in Massachusetts
      must promote inclusive neighborhoods where housing opportunities for families
      with children and those with low- and moderate-incomes can find homes just as
      easily as those with more wealth or no dependents households.\nProvide additional
      funds for preservation and production of affordable housing homes and to continue
      to fund existing smart-growth incentive zoning.\nAs federal funding for affordable
      housing becomes uncertain, tThe state should earmark fundingmake financial investments
      to that support municipalities with both production and preservation targets
      related to housing affordability. The state should also continue to fund the
      Commonwealth’s smart growth incentive programs under Chapters 40R and 40S so
      that municipalities cities and towns can feel confident that when they implement
      smart growth zoning overlays, any possible impacts on school capacity will be
      meaningfully offset by state funding."

      Determine affordability based on median income for by municipality
      Currently, affordable housing eligibility is based on area median income (AMI) for the metropolitan statistical area (MSA). For Greater Boston, the MSA is geographically a large area thatand includes municipalities in Middlesex, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Plymouth Counties (, and even parts of New Hampshire). Wealthy suburbs in this MSA drive up our median income, which ultimately means that most homes that much of the deed-restricted as affordable housing is are not actually affordable within financial reach of many of those who live in Greater Boston communities. Determining affordability based on local median income will ensure that deed-restricted housing is available for those who need it most.

  - title: Pass legislation aimed at increasing protections for renters.
    text: Legislation that would give tenants a right to counsel in eviction proceedings,
      require just-cause evictions, and offer tenants the right of first refusal in
      the event that their property is sold will help reduce housing insecurity. When
      tenants are protected in court proceedings, they are more likely to remain in
      their homes. Just-cause eviction laws protect tenants from unfair or discriminatory
      evictions, while a right of first refusal would give tenants an opportunity
      to purchase or assign their right to purchase a property, thereby increasing
      the likelihood that affordable home remains available in the community. Additionally,
      we should pass legislation that would give an income tax credit to landlords
      that rent at below-market rates, helping to incentivize these landlords to maintain
      rents that are affordable, especially for tenants whose wages have not increased,
      and to protect neighborhoods from the effects of gentrification.

- title: 'Ensure residents with low incomes, people of color, and other protected
    classes have access to homes that suits their needs. '
  text: Discriminatory practices still limit homeownership. For instance, high-income
    applicants who are Black or Latino are denied a mortgage at rates that are 7 to
    12 percentage points higher than applicants who are White and of similar economic
    status. Since homeownership gaps play a key role in the nation’s widening racial
    wealth gap, the racial disparities in Metro Boston homeownership rates and home
    loan denial rates are limiting the capacity of Metro Boston residents of color
    and their municipalities to build wealth.
  policies:
  - title: Continue to enforce the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule.
    text: The rule, promulgated under the Obama administration, required that jurisdictions
      that receive federal housing funding document barriers to integration and opportunity,
      but also that they detail and prioritize policies to eradicate these barriers.
      It is unclear how the current Department of Housing and Urban Development plans
      to enforce this rule in the short- and long-term, but every attempt should be
      made to preserve and prioritize it. At the local level, cities and towns should
      continue moving forward to develop Assessment of Fair Housing Plans.

  - title: Cap tear-downs and enforce bedroom mix policies.
    text: Across Greater Boston, small single-family homes are being torn down and
      replaced with larger, more expansive single-family properties. The new homes
      can gentrify neighborhoods quickly and displace current residents due to rising
      housing costs. At the same time, developers often disregard guidelines that
      require a bedroom mix that includes 3-bedroom units, instead opting to build
      studio, one and two-bedroom units. So as families are displaced from one neighborhood,
      there are few opportunities available to meet their family needs in others.
      Legislative action should cap the number of tear-downs that can occur within
      a given time period and require a specific bedroom mix for developments above
      a certain size (e.g., residential developments with more than 20 units).
  best_practice:
    text: "Planning processes should include significant community engagement and
      outreach to include participation from older adults, persons with disabilities,
      people of color, immigrants, people for whom English is not their primary language,
      and women.\n \nEquitable community engagement was a critical component of efforts
      to build on the vision for Downtown Lynn. MAPC partnered with the city of Lynn
      to convene a project team of advisors, conducted interviews with community leaders,
      gave presentations to community-based organizations, attended community events,
      talked with people we encountered on the street or at local businesses, interacted
      with community members using social media such as Facebook as well as via email,
      collected land use and property data using local volunteers, and hosted two
      public forums downtown. It is impractical to get input from every single resident,
      but this targeted approach provided an informed perspective to guide planning
      recommendations."

- title: Expand transportation options and run them more frequently for underserved
    populations and communities of color
  text: Our analysis shows that the region’s commuters of color often spend longer
    commuting than their White counterparts. Without a range of convenient transportation
    options, particularly public transit and safe pedestrian/bicycle infrastructure,
    marginalized communities may experience disproportionate impacts from vehicular
    emissions.
  policies:
  - title: Enact Regional Transportation Ballot Initiative Automatic voter registration
    text: This legislation would enable a municipality or a group of municipalities
      to raise additional local money for transportation projects via ballot initiatives,
      giving voters a more direct role in the process and also showing a clearer correlation
      between funds being raised and the project(s) for which those funds are used.

Metro Boston neighborhoods are becoming more economically segregated and racial desegregation lags significantly behind other metropolitan regions. The principle drivers of these trends are incredibly high housing prices, significant income disparities, and discriminatory lending and renting practices. Our current population and housing demand projections anticipate estimate that Metro Boston needs to build 329,000 units of housing – mostly multifamily – between 2010 and 2030 to meet increasing demand and improve maintain current affordability. Unfortunately, we are falling far short, meaning that our region is becoming increasingly unaffordable for families. Families are increasingly cost-burdened in our region, spending well over 30% of their income on housing. 

Since 2012 the rate of cost burden has been trending up for the renter population and down for the homeowner population. The trend, indicate a growing housing cost burden gap between homeowners and renters, and underscoring increasing the vulnerability of the region’s renters who are disproportionately people of color. Neighborhoods with a high concentration of cost-burdened residents, especially renters, are at risk of rapid population turnover when housing costs rise slightly or when these households face economic setbacks. Tempering the rising cost of living will be a critical step in ensuring that all Metro Boston residents’ earnings are  can have enough income to make a home and remain financially stable. 

At the same time, policies that encourage diversity do not necessarily promote inclusiveness. Immigrants, both documented and undocumented, are a critical component of Metro Boston’s economy and culture. Policies that exclude and ostracize immigrants reduce opportunities for them to engage civically, limiting the region’s progress and ability to thrive. New punitive federal immigration policies puts the onus on local governments to enact and enforce policies that make immigrants feel safe and that encourages them to engage with the people and placed around them.
