title: We have inclusive, diverse communities where everyone can afford to live and
  thrive.

strategies:
- title: Low and moderate income residents can afford to live in any part of the region
    they choose
  text: The lack of affordable housing options for all of Metro Boston residents impacts
    the region's ability to support young families and a thriving economy. Half the
    region's renters are housing cost burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of
    their household income on rent, and 30% of the region's homeowners are cost burdened.
    Policy responses to these drivers include boosting our supply of affordable.
  policies:
  - title: Enact Regional Transportation Ballot Initiative Automatic voter registration
    text: This legislation would enable a municipality or a group of municipalities
      to raise additional local money for transportation projects via ballot initiatives,
      giving voters a more direct role in the process and also showing a clearer correlation
      between funds being raised and the project(s) for which those funds are used.
  - title: Reduce MBTA fares for low income riders and enact fare capping policies.

  - title: Reduce and cap fines for fare evasion and do away with penalties for unpaid
      fines.

- title: Expand transportation options and run them more frequently for underserved
    populations and communities of color
  text: Our analysis shows that the region’s commuters of color often spend longer
    commuting than their White counterparts. Without a range of convenient transportation
    options, particularly public transit and safe pedestrian/bicycle infrastructure,
    marginalized communities may experience disproportionate impacts from vehicular
    emissions.

Metro Boston neighborhoods are becoming more economically segregated and racial desegregation lags significantly behind other metropolitan regions. The principle drivers of these trends are incredibly high housing prices, significant income disparities, and discriminatory lending and renting practices. Our current population and housing demand projections anticipate estimate that Metro Boston needs to build 329,000 units of housing – mostly multifamily – between 2010 and 2030 to meet increasing demand and improve maintain current affordability. Unfortunately, we are falling far short, meaning that our region is becoming increasingly unaffordable for families. Families are increasingly cost-burdened in our region, spending well over 30% of their income on housing. 

Since 2012 the rate of cost burden has been trending up for the renter population and down for the homeowner population. The trend, indicate a growing housing cost burden gap between homeowners and renters, and underscoring increasing the vulnerability of the region’s renters who are disproportionately people of color. Neighborhoods with a high concentration of cost-burdened residents, especially renters, are at risk of rapid population turnover when housing costs rise slightly or when these households face economic setbacks. Tempering the rising cost of living will be a critical step in ensuring that all Metro Boston residents’ earnings are  can have enough income to make a home and remain financially stable. 

At the same time, policies that encourage diversity do not necessarily promote inclusiveness. Immigrants, both documented and undocumented, are a critical component of Metro Boston’s economy and culture. Policies that exclude and ostracize immigrants reduce opportunities for them to engage civically, limiting the region’s progress and ability to thrive. New punitive federal immigration policies puts the onus on local governments to enact and enforce policies that make immigrants feel safe and that encourages them to engage with the people and placesd around them.
