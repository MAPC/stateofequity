intro:
  title: How do we define Equity?
  text: "> Equity is the condition of fair and just inclusion into a society in which
    all have full and equal access to opportunities, power, participation and resources.
    Equity will exist when all have avenues to safe, healthy, productive, and fulfilling
    lives. It requires restructuring deeply entrenched systems of privilege and oppression
    that have led to the uneven distribution of benefits and burdens over multiple
    generations. Society will be stronger when the promise in all of us is actualized.\n>
    \n> *With inspiration from: Policy Link, King County Office of Equity and Social
    Justice*\n\nThe policy agenda is made up of six different goals that, if achieved,
    will lead to greater equity across our region. If realized, this is what the Metro
    Boston region will look like in 2023:"

- title: Introduction
  text: "The Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) is the regional planning agency
    serving the people who live and work in the 101 cities and towns of Metropolitan
    Boston. Our mission is to promote smart growth and regional collaboration. Our
    regional plan, MetroFuture, guides our work as we engage the public in responsible
    stewardship of our region’s future. We work toward sound municipal management,
    sustainable land use, protection of natural resources, efficient and affordable
    transportation, a diverse housing stock, public safety, economic development,
    clean energy, healthy communities, an informed public, and equity and opportunity
    among people of all backgrounds.\n\nMAPC believes that achieving equity is paramount
    to the long-term economic and social well-being and sustainable future of the
    Metro Boston region, as well as the entire Commonwealth. \n\nIn an equitable region,
    everyone has a chance to grow up healthy, receive a quality education, achieve
    economic security, and enjoy life. An equitable Metro Boston is free from discrimination
    that marginalizes people based on race, sex, religion, disability, national origin,
    immigration status, sexual orientation, gender identify, family or marital status,
    income military status, criminal history or age. It lifts up leaders from marginalized
    groups and focuses on the experiences of the disenfranchised. MAPC is committed
    to seeking to advance equity in the region through our organizational policies,
    planning projects and public policy positions."
- title: Building a Roadmap for a More Equitable Region
  text: "In 2011, MAPC released “The State of Equity in Metro Boston,” an indicators
    report, which provided compelling detail on inequality across many sectors, including
    housing, transportation, public health, and contaminated environments. In 2014,
    MAPC adopted a strategic plan for the agency,[^1] and identified four strategic
    priorities, one of which was to play a leading role in helping the region to achieve
    greater equity. Later that same year, MAPC wrote “The State of Equity in Metro
    Boston: Policy Agenda,”[^2] which recommended policies and implementation steps
    needed to address the disparities highlighted in the 2011 indicators report. In
    February 2017, MAPC released a five-year update to the State of Equity indicators
    report, revisiting the 2011 indicators report to measure whether the region is
    moving towards, or away from, the vision for a more equitable future in our region.
    Now, we are releasing an update to the 2014 Policy Agenda. \n\nThe State of Equity
    Policy Agenda 2018 is a document that provides specific policy recommendations
    to address the myriad of disparities and to sustain the progress discussed in
    the 2017 State of Equity indicators report.[^3] The current political climate
    at the federal level has become more partisan and gridlocked over the past few
    months. This reinforces the importance of equity-focused work at the state and
    local level.\n\nThe recommendations found in this document seek to advance local
    and regional policy changes to eliminate – or at least to reverse – inequalities
    and inequities that exist in our region. Additionally, the Policy Agenda is not
    intended to be confined to the work of MAPC, but rather to serve as a tool for
    our coalition partners, legislators, state and municipal officials, policy experts,
    and other interested parties. We hope it will serve as a roadmap in pursuing real
    and meaningful change for all of our communities. \n\n[^1]:http://www.mapc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Strategic-plan-FINAL-DRAFT-for-Fall-Council-Meeting-10-29-14-2.pdf

- title: Progress & Update Process
  text: "In the past few years, Massachusetts has made some strides towards addressing
    inequities. We have passed legislation that protects transgender individuals,
    provides wage fairness and pay equity for women, and we have modestly increased
    the minimum wage. We have increased the Earned Income Tax Credit in order to provide
    a greater refund to low-income families, and we have provided funding for programs
    that aim to curb youth violence. These are all important steps, but they are only
    modest ones. We have much more work to do because we have not moved the equity
    needle far enough. Too many children in Massachusetts wake up hungry every day.
    Home affordability remains impossibly high for many households. Low-income families
    often have to choose among necessities like medicine, food and transportation
    because it’s just too hard to make ends meet. Some of our most marginalized residents
    often have very few options or paths to achieve success. And most of our cities,
    towns and neighborhoods remain segregated by race and income. \n\nTo start the
    update process for the 2018 policy agenda, our staff reviewed the 2014 Agenda
    to assess the progress made on those initial policy recommendations and the best
    practices that were highlighted in that document. We then invited voices from
    different fields, backgrounds and experiences to participate in an Advisory Committee.
    The Advisors we convened helped us to hone the list of issues we most needed to
    address and clarified the principles we used to create the policy agenda. Most
    importantly, Advisory Committee members assisted us in framing the policy suggestions
    and along with agency staff and representatives, provided us with the array of
    strategies considered for the new policy agenda. "

  text: "### Dedication\nWe dedicate the policy agenda to the numerous community and
    organization leaders whose tireless work has shown that all in the Boston region
    have the potential to succeed but that systemic and social barriers prevent such
    success. We make the contribution knowing it represents an ongoing process, one
    in which we look to be an active participant and an ally. We hope through shared
    work we can unlock the potential in all residents of the Metro Boston region.\n\n###

  title: Guiding Principles
  text: We developed a set of principles to help us highlight a key set of policy
    strategies, and related policy proposals, to act on in the next five years. The
    principles were developed based on input from a project Advisory Group, a review
    of relevant policy documents (e.g., PolicyLink’s All in Cities Toolkit, Minnesota
    Legislative Report Card on Racial Equity, City of Seattle’s Equity & Environment
    Agenda) and MAPC’s ongoing research into factors that are at the root of inequalities
    in the Metro Boston region. These principles layer on top of one another to form
    a kaleidoscope through which we see a composite rather than through one or only
    a few lenses when looking at how to address regional inequities.
