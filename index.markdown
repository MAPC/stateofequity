  title: How do we define Equity?
  text: "> Equity is the condition of fair and just inclusion into a society in which
    all have full and equal access to opportunities, power, participation and resources.
    Equity will exist when all have avenues to safe, healthy, productive, and fulfilling
    lives. It requires restructuring deeply entrenched systems of privilege and oppression
    that have led to the uneven distribution of benefits and burdens over multiple
    generations. Society will be stronger when the promise in all of us is actualized.\\\n>

  text: "The Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) is the regional planning agency
    serving the people who live and work in the 101 cities and towns of Metropolitan
    Boston. Our mission is to promote smart growth and regional collaboration. Our
    regional plan, MetroFuture, guides our work as we engage the public in responsible
    stewardship of our region’s future. We work toward sound municipal management,
    sustainable land use, protection of natural resources, efficient and affordable
    transportation, a diverse housing stock, public safety, economic development,
    clean energy, healthy communities, an informed public, and equity and opportunity
    among people of all backgrounds.\n\nMAPC believes that achieving equity is paramount
    to the long-term economic and social well-being and sustainable future of the
    Metro Boston region, as well as the entire Commonwealth. \n\nWe believe that equity
    means that all people have full and equal access to opportunities that enable
    them to attain their full potential.\n\nIn an equitable region, everyone has equal
    access to opportunities and each resident has a chance to grow up healthy, receive
    a quality education, get a well-paying job that ensures quality of life, and enjoy
    life into later years. An equitable Metro Boston is free from discrimination that
    marginalizes people based on race, sex, religion, disability, national origin,
    immigration status, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or marital status,
    income, military status, criminal history, or age. It holds up leaders from marginalized
    groups and centers the experiences of the disenfranchised. MAPC seeks to advance
    equity in the region through our organizational policies and project selection. "
- title: Equity at MAPC
  text: "In 2011, MAPC released “The State of Equity in Metro Boston,” a report providing
    compelling detail on inequality across many sectors, including housing, transportation,
    public health, and contaminated environments. In 2014, MAPC wrote “The State of
    Equity in Metro Boston: Policy Agenda” which attempted to provide recommendations
    of policies and implementation steps needed to address the disparities highlighted
    in the 2011 report. In February 2017, MAPC released a five-year update to the
    State of Equity indicators report, tracking the indicators over time. \n\nOf the
    many findings, the State of Equity indicators report update found that 1) even
    though the region is becoming more diverse, it is becoming more economically segregated;
    2) children’s health is improving, but there continue to be disparities—in some
    cases worsening—among different racial and ethnic groups that limit their long-term
    health, educational, and economic outcomes; 3) educational attainment disparities
    remain, even though the standardized test scores of students of all racial and
    ethnic backgrounds, and low-income students have improved; the scores of students
    with disabilities and English language learning students have not meaningfully
    improved, and these students have the lowest test scores of all groups 4) income
    and economic inequality has become worse; 5) Black and Latino residents, residents
    with disabilities, and residents without a college degree still face barriers
    to full employment; 6) residents of all backgrounds are living longer, but face
    financial challenges in their later years.\n\nThis “State of Equity Policy Agenda
    Update” is not just an update to the 2014 Policy Agenda, but a document meant
    to provide specific policy recommendations to address the myriad of disparities
    discussed in the 2017 State of Equity indicators report and beyond. The recommendations
    found in this document, seek to advance local and regional policy changes that
    mitigate and eliminate inequalities and inequities. Additionally, the Policy Agenda
    Update is not meant to be confined to the work of MAPC, but rather to serve as
    a tool for our partners, coalitions, legislators, municipal officials, policy
    experts, and other interested parties, for them to think about the ways they can
    pursue real and meaningful change for their respective communities. \n\n# **Process
    to update agenda (e.g., Advisory)**\nMAPC worked to ensure that the Policy Agenda
    and the input that went into this work, was done thoughtfully and intentionally.
    Our staff reviewed the 2014 Policy Agenda and assessed the progress made on those
    initial policy recommendations. MAPC organized an Advisory Committee to assist
    in framing and discussing what policy suggestions or topic areas must be included
    in this policy agenda update. It was important to MAPC and to this document, to
    invite voices from all different fields, backgrounds and experiences to our Advisory
    Committee. We held two meetings with the Advisory Committee. The first meeting
    was to provide an overview of the work MAPC had done on equity issues and to hear
    from those members on what equity issues most needed to be addressed. From this
    meeting, our staff compiled that list of issues and categorized them into the
    X # of topic issues of: . The second meeting was…..\n\nAfter our team completed
    the draft of policy recommendations, we had to pass it through our internal approval
    process which includes bringing it to our Legislative Committee, and then Executive
    Committee.\n"
- title: Political Climate
  text: The current political climate at the federal level has become more partisan
    and grid locked over the past few months. This however, reinforces the importance
    of being politically involved at the municipal and state level. Policymakers now
    have a unique opportunity to take back some of the responsibility that at times
    was defaulted to federal entities.
section_3:
  title: Guiding Principles
  text: We developed a set of principles to help us highlight a key set of policy
    items to act on the next five years. The principles were developed based on based
    of input from a set of project advisors, a review of relevant policy documents
    (e.g., ...) and MAPC’s ongoing research into factors that are at the root of disparities
    in the Metro Boston region. These principles form a composite through the layering
    of each and...
principles:
- title: Lead with Racial Equity
  content: Our current policies often reflect a system that has been historically
    biased. For example, <<drug laws, redlining>>. Race has been a key, if not the
    main, bias present in many of the policies that have produced the disparities
    identified in the Greater Boston region. Accepting this history means that we
    must push forward changes that do not perpetuate policies that reflect past biases.
    Therefore, we seek policies that lead with a race equity frame and that do not
    exclusively attend only to this root cause of inequity. There are a number of
    other biases integrated into our existing policy landscape, such as those that
    directly or indirectly discriminate against older adults, people with disabilities,
    those who have limited incomes, and families impacted by violence. We believe
    if these biases are rectified or removed, we will have a region that includes
    and support all residents regardless of background.

- title: Embrace Interdisciplinary Approaches
  content: 'Existing disparities are rarely the result of inequities within one system.
    We support policy changes that weave together multiple disciplines, linking together
    different experiences and knowledge in support of solving challenges (e.g., education,
    housing, and criminal justice). Several existing and emerging coalitions embrace
    this approach such as ... and we believe policy changes coming from these interdisciplinary
    groups represent the holistic actions necessary to eliminate inequitable outcomes. '
  illustration: "/assets/images/embrace.svg"
- title: Work Inside and Outside Existing Boundaries
  content: 'Past policy work shows that incremental changes to existing systems can
    address inequalities. However working within existing systems can also allow root
    causes of inequity and past biases to persist. In order to accelerate the realization
    of a more equitable region we look to policies that improve and reform existing
    systems as well as policies that dismantle or remove existing systems in order
    to create more equitable conditions. '
  illustration: "/assets/images/boundaries.svg"
- title: Scale Responses to Challenges
  content: 'Policy strategies should reflect the scale of challenge and the context
    of the inequality. We believe policies should reflect a necessary level of investment
    (e.g., funding, technical assistance, relief from statute, etc.) at the proper
    scale (regional, municipal, etc.) in the relevant sector (public or private).
    For example, in some cases, policies should empower cities and towns – individually
    or collectively – to address the disparities present in their communities. In
    other cases, policies will need to go beyond municipal boundaries to address causes
    of inequalities that are pervasive across regions and the state. '

- title: Move from Symptoms to Root Causes
  content: 'Crises require immediate responses and we believe individuals in urgent
    need should receive assistance through programmatic and policy responses. At the
    same time, we also recognize crises – immediate and those that become chronic
    - are frequently symptoms of more systemic issues. The crises have root causes
    in our society, emanating from policies, norms, and practices of a dominant culture.
    Our policy agenda seeks to blend changes that provide short-term relief for individuals
    affected by crises with those that address the root causes of the disparities
    found in our communities and region.

'

- title: Do No Harm
  content: "Policies that aim to eliminate disparities by addressing inequities are
    meant to prevent or remove harm, rather than just to manage consequences. Therefore,
    we support policies that rectify the uneven distribution of benefits and burdens.
    We also look for new policy proposals that from the start assess potential inequitable
    effects and remedy those elements. Evidence that blends from evaluation results
    with lived experiences should form the basis of these assessments and the updates
    that proposed policies undergo to assure that future policies do not prolong or
    create harm for those already unfairly burdened. \n"
