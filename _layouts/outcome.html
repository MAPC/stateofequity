      <h1>We have inclusive, diverse communities where everyone can afford to live and thrive.</h1>
      <p>
        Policies that encourage diversity do not necessarily promote inclusiveness. Immigrants, both 
        documented and undocumented, are a critical component of Metro Boston’s economy and culture. 
        Policies that exclude and ostracize immigrants reduce opportunities for them to engage civically, 
        limiting the region’s progress and ability to thrive. New punitive federal immigration policies 
        puts the onus on local governments to enact and enforce policies that make immigrants feel safe 
        and encourages them to engage with the people and placed around them.

        Low and moderate income residents can afford to live in any part of the region they choose

      <p>
        The lack of affordable housing options for all of Metro Boston residents impacts the region's 
        ability to support young families and a thriving economy. Half the region's renters are housing 
        cost burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their household income on rent, and 30% of the 
        region's homeowners are cost burdened. Policy responses to these drivers include boosting our 
        supply of affordable.

        Our analysis shows that the region’s commuters of color often spend longer commuting than their White

        pedestrian/bicycle infrastructure, marginalized communities may experience disproportionate impacts from 
        vehicular emissions.
