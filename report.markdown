    cross- sectoral indicators that measured inequity in the region. Those indicators
    informed the creation of MAPC’s State of Equity Policy Agenda in 2012. MAPC’s
    2017 update to the State of Equity was published in the Spring of 2017 and forms
    the basis for the agenda put forth in this document. The following section summarized
    the findings of the 2017 State of Equity report. For the full State of Equity
    report please visit <http://www.regionalindicators.org/topic_areas/7>\n\nThe indicators
    suggest that conditions which contribute to inequity are persisting or becoming
    more severe: discrimination, whether overt or systemic, continues to limit opportunity
    for some residents; income and wealth disparity is increasing, dimming the prospects
    for upward mobility; and residential segregation, especially segregation by income,
    is becoming more severe. "

    anchor: introduction
    text: "The Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) is the regional planning
      agency serving the people who live and work in the 101 cities and towns of Metropolitan
      Boston. Our mission is to promote smart growth and regional collaboration. Our
      regional plan, MetroFuture, guides our work as we engage the public in responsible
      stewardship of our region’s future. We work toward sound municipal management,
      sustainable land use, protection of natural resources, efficient and affordable
      transportation, a diverse housing stock, public safety, economic development,
      clean energy, healthy communities, an informed public, and equity and opportunity
      among people of all backgrounds.\n\nMAPC believes that achieving equity is paramount
      to the long-term economic and social well-being and sustainable future of the
      Metro Boston region, as well as the entire Commonwealth. \nWe believe that equity
      means that all people have full and equal access to opportunities that enable
      them to attain their full potential.\n\nIn an equitable region, everyone has
      equal access to opportunities and each resident has a chance to grow up healthy,
      receive a quality education, get a well-paying job that ensures quality of life,
      and enjoy life into later years. An equitable Metro Boston is free from discrimination
      that marginalizes people based on race, sex, religion, disability, national
      origin, immigration status, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or marital
      status, income, military status, criminal history, or age. It holds up leaders
      from marginalized groups and centers the experiences of the disenfranchised. MAPC
      seeks to advance equity in the region through our organizational policies and
      project selection. \n\n## MAPC Equity\nIn 2011, MAPC released “The State of
      Equity in Metro Boston,” a report providing compelling detail on inequality
      across many sectors, including housing, transportation, public health, and contaminated
      environments. In 2014, MAPC wrote “The State of Equity in Metro Boston: Policy
      Agenda” which attempted to provide recommendations of policies and implementation
      steps needed to address the disparities highlighted in the 2011 report. In February
      2017, MAPC released a five-year update to the State of Equity indicators report,
      tracking the indicators over time. \n\nOf the many findings, the State of Equity
      indicators report update found that 1) even though the region is becoming more
      diverse, it is becoming more economically segregated; 2) children’s health is
      improving, but there continue to be disparities—in some cases worsening—among
      different racial and ethnic groups that limit their long-term health, educational,
      and economic outcomes; 3) educational attainment disparities remain, even though
      the standardized test scores of students of all racial and ethnic backgrounds,
      and low-income students have improved; the scores of students with disabilities
      and English language learning students have not meaningfully improved, and these
      students have the lowest test scores of all groups 4) income and economic inequality
      has become worse; 5) Black and Latino residents, residents with disabilities,
      and residents without a college degree still face barriers to full employment;
      6) residents of all backgrounds are living longer, but face financial challenges
      in their later years.\n\nThis “State of Equity Policy Agenda Update” is not
      just an update to the 2014 Policy Agenda, but a document meant to provide specific
      policy recommendations to address the myriad of disparities discussed in the
      2017 State of Equity indicators report and beyond. The recommendations found
      in this document, seek to advance local and regional policy changes that mitigate
      and eliminate inequalities and inequities. Additionally, the Policy Agenda Update
      is not meant to be confined to the work of MAPC, but rather to serve as a tool
      for our partners, coalitions, legislators, municipal officials, policy experts,
      and other interested parties, for them to think about the ways they can pursue
      real and meaningful change for their respective communities. \n\n## Process
      to Update the Equity Policy Agenda \nMAPC worked to ensure that the Policy Agenda
      and the input that went into this work, was done thoughtfully and intentionally.
      Our staff reviewed the 2014 Policy Agenda and assessed the progress made on
      those initial policy recommendations. MAPC organized an Advisory Committee to
      assist in framing and discussing what policy suggestions or topic areas must
      be included in this policy agenda update. It was important to MAPC and to this
      document, to invite voices from all different fields, backgrounds and experiences
      to our Advisory Committee. We held two meetings with the Advisory Committee.
      The first meeting was to provide an overview of the work MAPC had done on equity
      issues and to hear from those members on what equity issues most needed to be
      addressed. From this meeting, our staff compiled that list of issues and categorized
      them into the X # of topic issues of: . The second meeting was…..\n\nAfter our
      team completed the draft of policy recommendations, we had to pass it through
      our internal approval process which includes bringing it to our Legislative
      Committee, and then Executive Committee.\n\n## The Policy Agenda and Essential
      Changes for a More Equitable Metro Boston Region\n\nThe current political climate
      at the federal level has become more partisan and grid locked over the past
      few months. This however, reinforces the importance of being politically involved
      at the municipal and state level. Policymakers now have a unique opportunity
      to take back some of the responsibility that at times was defaulted to federal
      entities."

  - title: Brief Overview
    anchor: previous-agenda-overview
    text: |-
      Metro Boston is becoming more diverse. In 1980, the region’s population was 8% people of color; by 2010, that figure had grown to 25%. MAPC projects that by 2040 the region will be at least 40% people of color. Even as it grows more diverse, the region remains racially and economically segregated. The Dissimilarity Index, which measures the extent to which two groups are similarly distributed across the region, has shown decreasing Black- White segregation since 1980.

      However, the Dissimilarity Index for Latinos and Whites is now higher than it was in 1990, indicating a greater degree of segregation between the two groups. Other measures of economic segregation demonstrate that the region’s poorest households are becoming increasingly concentrated into low-income neighborhoods with little income diversity.
  - title: Summary of Progress
    anchor: progress-summary
    text: 'People of color live in less-affluent neighborhoods than white households
      with comparable earnings. Odds are that a White household earning $78,000 per
      year lives in a neighborhood where the median household income of its neighbors
      is $72,000. Meanwhile, a Black household earning exactly the same is likely
      to live in a neighborhood where the median income is just $51,000. This disparity
      has increased substantially since 2000. '
