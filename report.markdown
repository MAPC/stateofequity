  anchor: introduction
  text: "The Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) is the regional planning agency
    serving the people who live and work in the 101 cities and towns of Metropolitan
    Boston. Our mission is to promote smart growth and regional collaboration. Our
    regional plan, MetroFuture, guides our work as we engage the public in responsible
    stewardship of our region’s future. We work toward sound municipal management,
    sustainable land use, protection of natural resources, efficient and affordable
    transportation, a diverse housing stock, public safety, economic development,
    clean energy, healthy communities, an informed public, and equity and opportunity
    among people of all backgrounds.\n\nMAPC believes that achieving equity is paramount
    to the long-term economic and social well-being and sustainable future of the
    Metro Boston region, as well as the entire Commonwealth. \nWe believe that equity
    means that all people have full and equal access to opportunities that enable
    them to attain their full potential.\n\nIn an equitable region, everyone has equal
    access to opportunities and each resident has a chance to grow up healthy, receive
    a quality education, get a well-paying job that ensures quality of life, and enjoy
    life[^foot] into later years. An equitable Metro Boston is free from discrimination
    that marginalizes people based on race, sex, religion, disability, national origin,
    immigration status, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or marital status,
    income, military status, criminal history, or age. It holds up leaders from marginalized
    groups and centers the experiences of the disenfranchised. MAPC seeks to advance
    equity in the region through our organizational policies and project selection.

    anchor: equity-mapc
    text: 'In 2011, MAPC released “The State of Equity in Metro Boston,” a report
      providing compelling detail on inequality across many sectors, including housing,
      transportation, public health, and contaminated environments. In 2014, MAPC
      wrote “The State of Equity in Metro Boston: Policy Agenda” which attempted to
      provide recommendations of policies and implementation steps needed to address
      the disparities highlighted in the 2011 report. In February 2017, MAPC released
      a five-year update to the State of Equity indicators report, tracking the indicators
      over time.'
  - title: Process to Update the Equity Agenda Update
    anchor: process
    text: |-
      MAPC worked to ensure that the Policy Agenda and the input that went into this work, was done thoughtfully and intentionally. Our staff reviewed the 2014 Policy Agenda and assessed the progress made on those initial policy recommendations. MAPC organized an Advisory Committee to assist in framing and discussing what policy suggestions or topic areas must be included in this policy agenda update. It was important to MAPC and to this document, to invite voices from all different fields, backgrounds and experiences to our Advisory Committee. We held two meetings with the Advisory Committee. The first meeting was to provide an overview of the work MAPC had done on equity issues and to hear from those members on what equity issues most needed to be addressed. From this meeting, our staff compiled that list of issues and categorized them into the X # of topic issues of: . The second meeting was…..

      After our team completed the draft of policy recommendations, we had to pass it through our internal approval process which includes bringing it to our Legislative Committee, and then Executive Committee.

      Region
    anchor: essential-changes
    text: The current political climate at the federal level has become more partisan
      and grid locked over the past few months. This however, reinforces the importance
      of being politically involved at the municipal and state level. Policymakers
      now have a unique opportunity to take back some of the responsibility that at
      times was defaulted to federal entities.
- title: Previous SOE Policy Agenda
  anchor: previous-agenda
  text: "The 2014 Equity Policy Agenda was released to serve as an update to the MetroFuture
    Implementation Strategies and was based on the findings of the 2011 State of Equity
    in Metro Boston Indicators Report. The report made recommendations in three main
    categories:\n\n1)\tInvest in places\n2)\tInvest in people\n3)\tBuild more equitable
    public systems\n\nThe recommendations outlined in the report included planning,
    policy and funding changes at every level of government and steps that could be
    taken by the private sector and individual households. \n\nMany of the recommendations
    in the 2014 policy agenda highlighted a best practice area that a city or town
    could undertake and that required no legislative or policy change. While the best
    practices included are often the low-hanging fruit that can be easily accomplished,
    the previous policy agenda did not include policy strategies or specific policy
    actions for some of the biggest inequities facing our region, such as...\n\n###
    Progress and Next Steps\n\nIn the past few years, Massachusetts has made some
    strides towards addressing inequities. We have passed legislation that protects
    transgender individuals, provides wage fairness and pay equity for women, and
    we have modestly increased the minimum wage. We have increased the Earned Income
    Tax Credit in order to provide a refund to low-income families, and we have provided
    funding for programs that aim to curb youth violence. These are all important
    steps that we have taken to address pressing needs in the Commonwealth. \n\nBut
    there is more work to do because we have not moved the needle enough. Too many
    children in Massachusetts wake up hungry every day. Home affordability remains
    impossibly high for most families. Low-income families often have to choose between
    medicine and transportation. And some of our most marginalized residents often
    have very few options or paths to achieve success."
- title: Indicators Overview
  anchor: indicators
  text: "In 2011 MAPC released The State of Equity in Metro Boston, an inventory of
    cross- sectoral indicators that measured inequity in the region. Those indicators
    informed the creation of MAPC’s State of Equity Policy Agenda in 2014. MAPC’s
    2017 update to the State of Equity indicators report was published in February,
    2017 and forms the basis for the agenda put forth in this document. The following
    section summarizes major findings of the 2017 State of Equity indicators report.

  subsections:
  - title: Diversity and Segregation
    anchor: diversity
    text: "Metro Boston is becoming more diverse every decade. In 1970, the region’s
      population was 5% people of color—Asian, Black, Latino, Native American, multiracial
      and other non-White residents; by 2010, that figure had grown to 28%. MAPC projects
      that by 2040 the region will be at least 40% people of color. The region has
      also grown in share of foreign-born residents, and as of 2011-2015, 20% of Metro
      Boston residents were born outside of the U.S. Even as it grows more diverse,
      the region remains racially and economically segregated. \nThe Dissimilarity
      Index, which measures the extent to which two groups are similarly distributed
      across the region, has shown decreasing Black – White segregation since 1980.
      However, the Dissimilarity Index for Latinos and Whites is now higher than it
      was in 1990, indicating a greater degree of segregation between the two groups.
      Other measures of economic segregation demonstrate that the region’s poorest
      households are becoming increasingly concentrated into low-income neighborhoods
      with little income diversity."
  - title: Housing
    anchor: housing
    text: People of color live in less-affluent neighborhoods than white households
      with comparable earnings. Odds are that a White household earning $78,000 per
      year lives in a neighborhood where the median household income of its neighbors
      is $72,000. Meanwhile, a Black household earning exactly the same is likely
      to live in a neighborhood where the median income is just $51,000. This disparity
      has increased substantially since 2000.
  - title: Health
    anchor: health
    text: "In 2011, we found that racial disparities in low birth weight eclipsed
      the differences attributable to education level, most notably for Black women.
      Based on 2005-2009 data, a college-educated Black woman was 40% more likely
      to have a low birth weight baby than a White woman without a high school diploma
      (8.5% among Black women with a college degree, 6.2% among White women with less
      than a high school degree). In 2017, with more recent data, we found that instances
      of low birth weight among Black women have declined slightly (from 10.4% in
      2005-2009 to 9.4% in 2010-2014 among Black women without a high school degree,
      and from 8.5% to 7.2% among Black women with a college degree), but the significant
      preexisting disparity means that those gains have not substantially bridged
      the gap between White women and Black women. \nRacial health disparities continue
      into childhood. In fact, in the case of childhood asthma, disparities have become
      more severe over time. Data from 2008-2012 show a 10% increase in overall youth
      asthma hospitalizations, compared to data from 2003-2007. This increase was
      driven by statistically significant increases in Black and Latino youth rates.
      Black youth in the more recent data experienced a rate of asthma hospitalization
      2.7 times higher than the regional average, and climbing. While the rates for
      Latino youth were closer to the regional average, they increased 22% over the
      five year interval."
  - title: Education
    anchor: education
    text: Standardized test performance improved across almost all demographic categories
      between 2009 and 2015, and the gains were largest for Black and Latino students.
      For the 10th Grade Math MCAS, the percent of Black and Latino students scoring
      Advanced or Proficient grew by 9 percentage points and 7 percentage points,
      respectively. The gap in scores between these groups and White students dropped
      by 5 points and 3 points, though the gaps remain large, at 26 points. These
      groups also saw even larger increases in their four-year graduation rates, and
      the gap in graduation rate with Whites fell by one quarter. Suspension rates
      in schools with more than 50% students of color are half of what they were in
      2006 – 2007, though they still remain twice as high as the average for all schools
      in the region.
  - title: Income
    anchor: income
    text: The most recent earnings data show that income polarization is increasing,
      and that this polarization disproportionately affects Black and Latino residents.
      The average income for the highest-earning fifth of households ($280,600) is
      18 times higher than average income for the lowest-income fifth of households
      ($15,800). That disparity has increased by two points since 2006. The highest-income
      fifth earns 15% more than it did in 2006, while the lowest-income fifth earns
      just 3% more. This can be attributed in part to wage polarization and the decline
      of the middle class. This polarization disproportionately affects Black and
      Latino households, whose median household incomes are less than half those of
      White and Asian households.
  - title: Homeownership
    anchor: homeownership
    text: Homeownership is one of the cornerstones of building wealth in America.
      MAPC’s 2011 report found that people of color—even those who earn a substantial
      income—face continued discrimination in choosing where to live. In particular,
      high-income applicants (those earning more than $118,000 per year) who are Black
      are more than twice as likely to be denied a mortgage as high-income borrowers
      who are White. For Black applicants, the denial rate dropped 4.7 percentage
      points, and for high-income Latino applicants the denial rate dropped 3.3 percentage
      points. While homeownership rates overall have dropped slightly in the last
      ten years, the declines have been most substantial for Black and Latino householders,
      whose homeownership rates (32% and 25%, respectively) are less than half of
      homeownership rates for White householders (68%).
  - title: Employment
    anchor: employment
    text: Metro Boston’s economy has been growing robustly since the Great Recession,
      and by the end of 2016 the Metro Boston’s official unemployment rate was 2.5%,
      according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). However, not everyone is
      benefiting equally from this growth. Labor force participation rate (the share
      of the working-age population working or looking for a job) for people with
      only a high school degree is 12 percentage points lower than the rate for those
      with a bachelor’s degree, and trending downward. The unemployment rate for workers
      who are Black is nearly 7 percentage points higher than the rate for workers
      who are White, and the Latino rate is nearly 5 points higher. The unemployment
      rate for people with a disability is more than ten percentage points higher
      than for people without a disability.
  - title: Criminal Justice
    anchor: criminal-justice
    text: Inequities in incarceration follow clear socioeconomic and geographic trends
      that carry significant implications for individuals, families, communities,
      and the region. For individuals, encounters with the criminal justice system
      can have long-term impacts on earning power and employability, as well as mental
      and physical health. The number of inmates in Massachusetts Department of Corrections
      (DOC) facilities statewide dropped by 12% from 2010 to 2016, and the disparities
      in incarceration rate for residents who are Black and Latino also declined,
      albeit slowly. Black and Latino inmates are severely over-represented in (DOC)
      facilities. Although the state population is 7% Black and 11% Latino, the state’s
      DOC inmates are 27% Black and 25% Latino. Native Americans residents, as of
      2016, have the highest rate of incarceration in the state’s prison system.
  - title: Senior
    anchor: senior
    text: "As the Baby Boomer generation ages, the region will experience substantial
      growth in the senior population, which may grow by 75% between 2010 and 2030.
      Above-average premature mortality rates for White and Black residents declined
      between 2003-2007 and 2008-2012, while rates for Asian, Latino, and Native American
      residents remained statistically unchanged. Black residents continue to have
      the highest premature mortality rate (348 per 100,000.) \nGrandparents responsible
      for their grandchildren have a poverty rate of more than 15%, double that of
      grandparents not responsible for their grandchildren. Older adults are more
      housing cost burdened (meaning that they pay more than 30% of their income on
      housing) than younger adults. Nearly 60% of renter households headed by an older
      adult are cost burdened, and more than a third of households where the homeowner
      is an older adult are cost burdened. Despite a 5% drop in the total number of
      housing cost burdened young home owners, the renter and owner housing cost burden
      rates for the elderly remained unchanged between 2005-2009 and 2011-2015."
- title: Guiding Principles for Policy Priorities
  anchor: principles
  text: "We developed a set of principles to help us[^another] highlight a key set
    of policy strategies, and related policy proposals, to act on in the next five
    years. The principles were developed based on input from a project Advisory Group,
    a review of relevant policy documents (e.g., PolicyLink’s All in Cities Toolkit,
    Minnesota Legislative Report Card on Racial Equity, City of Seattle’s Equity &
    Environment Agenda) and MAPC’s ongoing research into factors that are at the root
    of inequalities in the Metro Boston region. These principles layer on top of one
    another to form a kaleidoscope through which we see a composite rather than through
    one or only a few lenses when looking at how to address regional inequities.\n\n[^another]:
    This a footnote that comes in a different section of the site. "
  subsections:
  - title: Lead with Racial Equity
    anchor: racial-equity
    text: Our current policies often reflect a system that has been historically biased.
      For example, <<drug laws, redlining>>. Race has been a key, if not the main,
      bias present in many of the policies that have produced the disparities identified
      in the Greater Boston region. Accepting this history means that we must push
      forward changes that do not perpetuate policies that reflect past biases. Therefore,
      we seek policies that lead with a race equity frame and that do not exclusively
      attend only to this root cause of inequity. There are a number of other biases
      integrated into our existing policy landscape and that contribute, directly
      or indirectly, to discrimination experienced by other groups. We believe if
      these biases are rectified or removed, we will have a region that includes and
      support all residents, regardless of background.
  - title: Embrace Interdisciplinary Approaches
    anchor: interdisciplinary-approaches
    text: Existing disparities are rarely the result of inequities within one system.
      We support policy changes that weave together multiple disciplines, linking
      together different experiences and knowledge in support of solving common challenges
      (e.g., education, housing, and criminal justice). Several existing and emerging
      coalitions embrace this approach such as those leading the Great Neighborhoods
      Campaign and the Jobs not Jails Campaign. We believe policy changes coming from
      interdisciplinary groups represent the holistic actions necessary to eliminate
      inequitable outcomes.
  - title: Work Inside and Outside Existing Systems
    anchor: inside-outsidesystems
    text: 'Past policy work shows that incremental changes to existing systems can
      address inequalities. However working within existing systems can also allow
      root causes of inequity and past biases to persist or be perpetuated. In order
      to accelerate the realization of a more equitable region we look to policies
      that improve and reform existing systems as well as policies that dismantle
      or remove existing systems in order to create more equitable conditions. '
  - title: Scale Responses to Challenges
    anchor: scale
    text: Policy strategies should reflect the scale of challenge and the context
      of the inequality. We believe policies should reflect a necessary level of investment
      (e.g., funding, technical assistance, relief from statute, etc.) at the proper
      scale (regional, municipal, etc.) in the relevant sector (public or private).
      For example, in some cases, policies should empower cities and towns – individually
      or collectively – to address the disparities present in their communities. In
      other cases, policies will need to go beyond municipal boundaries to address
      causes of inequalities that are pervasive across regions and the state.
  - title: Move from Symptoms to Root Causes
    anchor: symptom-root
    text: Crises require immediate responses and we believe individuals in urgent
      need should receive assistance through programmatic and policy responses. At
      the same time, we also recognize crises – immediate and those that become chronic
      - are frequently symptoms of more systemic issues. The crises have root causes
      in our society, emanating from policies, norms, and practices of a dominant
      culture. Our policy agenda seeks to blend changes that provide short-term relief
      for individuals affected by crises with those that address the root causes of
      the disparities found in our neighborhoods, municipalities, and region.
  - title: Mitigate and Prevent Harm
    anchor: mitigate-harm
    text: Policies that aim to eliminate disparities by addressing inequities are
      meant to prevent or remove harm, rather than just to manage consequences. Therefore,
      we support policies that rectify the uneven distribution of benefits and burdens.
      We also look for new policy proposals that from the start assess potential inequitable
      effects and remedy those elements prior to passage. Evidence that blends evaluation
      results (e.g., “what works” resources) with lived experiences should form the
      basis of the updates to policies undergo in order to assure that future actions
      do not prolong or create harm for those already unfairly burdened.
- title: Policy Agenda 2017 – 2022
  anchor: policy-agenda
  text: "The policy agenda is made up of six different goals that, if achieved, will
    lead to greater equity across our region. If realized, this is what the Metro
    Boston region will look like in 2022:\n \n### 1.\tWe have inclusive, diverse communities
    where everyone can afford to live and thrive.\n### 2.\tWe have convenient and
    affordable options to access good jobs, schools and recreation.\n### 3.\tWe have
    good jobs and pathways to prosperity.\n### 4.\tWe solidify our foundation in education
    by offering affordable and quality education, from pre-school to college.\n###
    5.\tWe eliminate conditions and harmful environments that leave people sick or
    injured.\n### 6.\tWe have a public safety and justice system that protects residents
    of all backgrounds.\n\nUnder each of these goals, we highlight several strategies
    that will help to achieve the goals and under each strategy, we outline policy
    tactics that the legislature and the Administration should pass in order to make
    our region more equitable.\n\n> Example of Policy Agenda Layout, GOAL: WE HAVE
    INCLUSIVE, DIVERSE COMMUNITIES WHERE EVERYONE CAN AFFORD TO LIVE AND THRIVE(Policy
    Strategy) \nProtect tenants, increase the supply of homes that low-and middle-income
    families can afford to buy, and help all residents stay where they live\n(Policy
    Action) *Pass comprehensive zoning reform in order to encourage affordable housing
    production and eliminate discriminatory zoning practices.\n\nWe recognize that
    these goals, strategies and actions are related to each other. If, for example,
    we move towards a restorative justice system, this move will have a profound impact
    on workforce development, housing opportunities and public health outcomes. So,
    although the Policy Agenda identifies specific strategies and actions under a
    particular goal, the document serves as a cohesive, interdependent agenda, not
    as siloed policy change efforts. "
  subsections:
  - title: We have inclusive, diverse communities where everyone can afford to live
      and thrive.
    anchor: diversity-agenda
    text: "Metro Boston neighborhoods are becoming more economically segregated and
      racial desegregation lags significantly behind other metropolitan regions. The
      principle drivers of these trends are high housing prices, income disparities,
      and discriminatory lending and renting practices. Our current population and
      housing demand projections estimate that Metro Boston needs to build 435,000
      units of housing – mostly multifamily – between 2010 and 2040 to meet increasing
      demand and maintain current affordability. Unfortunately, we are falling far
      short, meaning that our region is becoming increasingly unaffordable for families.
      Families are increasingly cost-burdened in our region, spending well over 30%
      of their income on housing. \n\nSince 2012 the rate of cost burden has been
      trending up for the renter population and down for the homeowner population.
      The trend indicates a growing housing cost burden gap between homeowners and
      renters, increasing the vulnerability of the region’s renters who are disproportionately
      people of color. Neighborhoods with a high concentration of cost-burdened residents,
      especially renters, are at risk of rapid population turnover when housing costs
      rise slightly or when these households face economic setbacks. Tempering the
      rising cost of living will be a critical step in ensuring that all Metro Boston
      residents’ earnings are enough to make a home and remain financially stable.
      \n\nAt the same time, policies that encourage affordability do not necessarily
      promote inclusiveness. Immigrants, both documented and undocumented, are a critical
      component of Metro Boston’s economy and culture. Policies that exclude and ostracize
      immigrants reduce opportunities for them to engage civically, limiting the region’s
      progress. New punitive federal immigration policies put the onus on local governments
      to enact and enforce policies that make immigrants feel safe and that encourage
      them to engage with the people and places around them.\n\n### i.\tProtect tenants,
      increase the supply of homes that low-and middle-income families can afford
      to buy, and help all residents stay where they live\n\nThe lack of affordable
      housing options in Metro Boston negatively impacts the region’s ability to house
      our economically and ethnically diverse residential base and to support a thriving
      economy. Half the region’s renters and 30% of homeowners are cost burdened,
      meaning they spend more than 30% of their annual household income on housing.
      Policy responses to the affordability crisis include preserving the existing
      affordable housing supply, increasing the stock of housing, both affordable
      and market rate, and ensuring that below market-rate units are occupied by households
      with corresponding incomes. \n\n* Pass comprehensive zoning reform in order
      to encourage affordable housing production and eliminate discriminatory zoning
      practices.\n\nMassachusetts has not updated its zoning laws in over 40 years.
      Municipalities across the Commonwealth use existing zoning laws as a way to
      prevent changes that would allow more affordable homes, condominiums, and apartments.
      \n\nAn update to the Commonwealth’s outdated zoning laws should require cities
      and towns to create neighborhoods of more affordable homes and should encourage
      municipalities to adopt bylaws or ordinances that require private developers
      to contribute when they are building market rate or luxury housing. Both of
      these tools will help to increase housing affordability in Metro Boston and
      across the Commonwealth.  \n\nMassachusetts has a long history of residential
      segregation, which can be traced to restrictive local zoning and permitting
      decisions. Comprehensive zoning reform in Massachusetts must promote inclusive
      neighborhoods where families with children and those with low- and moderate-incomes
      can find homes just as easily as those with more wealth or no dependents.\n\n*
      Provide additional funds for preservation and production of affordable homes
      and continue to fund existing smart-growth incentive zoning.\n\nThe state should
      make financial investments that support municipalities with both production
      and preservation targets related to housing affordability. The state should
      continue to fund the Commonwealth’s smart growth incentive programs under Chapters
      40R and 40S so that cities and towns can feel confident that when they implement
      smart growth zoning overlays, possible impacts on school capacity will be meaningfully
      offset by state funding.\n\n> Emerging Practice: Managing Neighborhood Change
      \nLower-income households are disproportionately impacted by more negative outcomes,
      including housing cost burden and the risk of displacement, that are associated
      with new investment in housing, businesses, and infrastructure. Managing Neighborhood
      Change (MNC) is a data- and community-driven analysis and visioning process
      that engages residents in a community dialogue around neighborhood change, including
      what is welcome and what is cause for concern.  MNC draws on housing and demographic
      data, in addition to resident experiences, to provide strategies that mitigate
      the risks of change and more equitably distribute the benefits of new investments.
      \n\n* Pass legislation aimed at increasing protections for renters.\n\nLegislation
      that would give tenants a right to counsel in eviction proceedings, require
      just-cause evictions, and offer tenants the right of first refusal in the event
      that their property is sold will help reduce housing insecurity. When tenants
      are protected in court proceedings, they are more likely to remain in their
      homes. Just-cause eviction laws protect tenants from unfair or discriminatory
      evictions, while a right of first refusal would give tenants an opportunity
      to purchase or assign their right to purchase a property, thereby increasing
      the likelihood that affordable home remains available in the community. Additionally,
      we should pass legislation that would give an income tax credit to landlords
      that rent at below-market rates, helping to incentivize these landlords to maintain
      rents that are affordable, especially for tenants whose wages have not increased,
      and to protect neighborhoods from the effects of gentrification. \nDetermine
      affordability based on median income by municipality\n\nCurrently, affordable
      housing eligibility is based on area median income (AMI) for the metropolitan
      statistical area (MSA). For Greater Boston, the MSA is geographically large
      and includes municipalities in Middlesex, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Plymouth
      Counties (and even parts of New Hampshire). Wealthy suburbs in this MSA drive
      up our median income, which ultimately means that most homes that deed-restricted
      as affordable are not actually within financial reach of many who live in Greater
      Boston. Determining affordability based on local median income will ensure that
      deed-restricted housing is available for those who need it most. \n\n### ii.\tEnsure
      residents with low incomes, people of color, and other protected classes have
      access to homes that suits their needs. \n\nDiscriminatory practices still limit
      homeownership. For instance, high-income applicants who are Black or Latino
      are denied a mortgage at rates that are 7 to 12 percentage points higher than
      applicants who are White and of similar economic status. Since homeownership
      gaps play a key role in the nation’s widening racial wealth gap,  the racial
      disparities in Metro Boston homeownership rates and home loan denial rates are
      limiting the capacity of Metro Boston residents of color and their municipalities
      to build wealth. \n\n* Continue to enforce the Affirmatively Furthering Fair
      Housing rule.\n\nThe rule, promulgated under the Obama administration, required
      that jurisdictions that receive federal housing funding document barriers to
      integration and opportunity, but also that they detail and prioritize policies
      to eradicate these barriers. It is unclear how the current Department of Housing
      and Urban Development plans to enforce this rule in the short- and long-term,
      but every attempt should be made to preserve and prioritize it. At the local
      level, cities and towns should continue moving forward to develop Assessment
      of Fair Housing Plans. \n\n* Cap tear-downs and enforce bedroom mix policies.\n\nAcross
      Greater Boston, small single-family homes are being torn down and replaced with
      larger, more expansive single-family properties. The new homes can gentrify
      neighborhoods quickly and displace current residents due to rising housing costs.
      At the same time, developers often disregard guidelines that require a bedroom
      mix that includes 3-bedroom units, instead opting to build studio, one and two-bedroom
      units. So as families are displaced from one neighborhood, there are few opportunities
      available to meet their family needs in others. Legislative action should cap
      the number of tear-downs that can occur within a given time period and require
      a specific bedroom mix for developments above a certain size (e.g., residential
      developments with more than 20 units).\n\n> BEST PRACTICE FOR MUNIS: Community
      Engagement and Outreach.\nPlanning processes should include significant community
      engagement and outreach to include participation from older adults, persons
      with disabilities, people of color, immigrants, people for whom English is not
      their primary language, and women.\n \nEquitable community engagement was a
      critical component of efforts to build on the vision for Downtown Lynn. MAPC
      partnered with the city of Lynn to convene a project team of advisors, conducted
      interviews with community leaders, gave presentations to community-based organizations,
      attended community events, talked with people we encountered on the street or
      at local businesses, interacted with community members using social media such
      as Facebook as well as via email, collected land use and property data using
      local volunteers, and hosted two public forums downtown. It is impractical to
      get input from every single resident, but this targeted approach provided an
      informed perspective to guide planning recommendations.\n\n\n## iii.\tEnsure
      that our communities are inclusive, representative and democratic \n\nIn order
      for residents living in Metro Boston to thrive and contribute to their fullest,
      they must feel a sense of inclusivity, belonging, and control. Voting must continue
      to be a right, preserved by removing barriers to voter registration that could
      limit turnout or participation. Voting rights could even be extended so that
      every resident of an area, regardless of citizenship status, could participate
      in local elections. Beyond voting, current immigration policies often prevent
      undocumented residents from meaningfully participating in regular civic processes.
      Yet undocumented immigrants produce incredible value for the region. If undocumented
      immigrants were deported, the region would face severe financial impacts; one
      estimate suggests Massachusetts would lose approximately $12 billion in economic
      activity and over 55,000 jobs.  \n\nOn the other hand, a more recent study estimates
      that securing lawful permanent residence for undocumented immigrants would generate
      over $259 million in state and local taxes, on top of the taxes that undocumented
      immigrants already pay.  \nUndocumented residents should be given protections
      to remain in the Commonwealth. \n\n* Enact automatic voter registration throughout
      Massachusetts\n\nAutomatic voter registration enables a government agency, usually
      the Registry of Motor Vehicles, to automatically register a citizen upon state
      license or ID issuance or renewal, unless the person declines to do so. The
      citizen’s information is then sent to the appropriate election office for verification
      of voting eligibility. Currently, nine states and the District of Columbia have
      enacted automatic voter registration policies, as they serve to increase voter
      registration rates and help to eliminate existing barriers to voter registration.
      \n\n* Make Massachusetts a sanctuary state\nSanctuary state legislation would
      prohibit state and local resources from being used to enforce federal immigration
      laws and would prevent law enforcement officers from inquiring about an individual’s
      immigration status unless it is pertinent to the crime at issue. The legislation
      would further limit Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents from accessing
      information on booking lists or release dates unless a person is serving a sentence
      for a serious violent felony. Ensuring that our communities remain welcoming
      to all residents, regardless of where they come from or the circumstances of
      their arrival, is important to the long-term economic and social wellbeing of
      the entire Commonwealth. \n\n* Create a process that allows non-citizen immigrants
      to vote in municipal elections\n\nAcross the country, several municipalities
      or counties have allowed non-citizen residents to vote in municipal elections,
      under the theory that all residents should be involved in municipal service
      delivery. Historically, until 1926, 40 states allowed non-citizens to vote in
      municipal and state elections, a policy that was reversed as nativist sentiments
      rose in the United States.  \n\n> BEST PRACTICE: Municipal Support and Outreach
      to Immigrant Residents\nCities and towns across the country offer training to
      municipal employees to learn how to engage with undocumented residents and with
      government agencies like the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. In
      Portland, Oregon the Human Resources Bureau, along with the Office of Equity
      and Human Rights and they City Attorney’s office developed a plan for training
      city workers how to respond to federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.
      \n\n* Cultivate competency for service provision to residents who are lesbian,
      gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer\n\nAs a just and fair society, we seek
      and use approaches that allow for greater inclusion. In Metro Boston and Massachusetts,
      there are policy actions that can foster greater inclusion and responsiveness
      to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) residents. This includes
      partnering with representatives of the LGBTQ to build capacity in public and
      private service providers for greater cultural competency. An example of such
      a proposal is the An Act Relative to LGBT Awareness Training for Aging Services
      Provider, which would support development of a training program for the delivery
      of accessible and appropriate services to LGBTQ older adults and their caregivers.
      This act would prevent older LGBTQ residents from any need to hide their identity
      and receive care that is relevant and respectful.\n"
  - title: We have convenient and affordable options to access good jobs, schools
      and recreation
    anchor: affordability
    text: "Metro Boston’s residents depend on the region’s transportation system to
      connect them to school, work, services, and recreational activities. Despite
      the many ways residents of the region get around, transportation improvements
      have tended to promote one form of travel – driving alone – rather than emphasizing
      access to destinations regardless of how a person travels. As a result, many
      residents face substantial challenges when commuting to work, getting to the
      doctor’s office, or visiting friends. This is especially true for low-income
      households who do not own or cannot afford a vehicle, young people and older
      adults who cannot drive, and people with mobility impairments. Those individual
      and household constraints are compounded by historical and ongoing disparities
      in transit service available for low-income communities and communities of color.\n \n###
      Expand transportation options, particularly for underserved populations and
      communities of color, and decrease transportation costs for cost-burdened households.
      \n\nThe region’s commuters of color spend more time commuting than their White
      counterparts. Without a range of convenient transportation options, particularly
      public transit and safe pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, marginalized
      communities have limited mobility options and yet are likely to experience disproportionate
      impacts from vehicular emissions. \n\nThese same communities often spend a disproportionate
      percentage of their household incomes on transportation costs. As MBTA, Commuter
      Rail and event Regional Transit costs continue to rise, we have seen a steady
      decrease in the real dollar value of the gas tax since 1996. Equitable transportation
      means providing a range of travel options to low-income communities and communities
      of color, all of which are affordable, reliable, safe and sustainable.\n \n1.
      Enact Regional Transportation Ballot Initiatives to support active transportation
      investments\n\nThis legislation would allow a municipality or group of municipalities
      to raise additional local money for transportation projects via a ballot initiative,
      giving voters a more direct role in the transportation funding process and creating
      a lock box of funds for specific investments. In many communities across our
      region, we expect that these funds would be used to create alternative transportation
      investments, or to increase investments in the existing system. At the same
      time, a frequent criticism of this local option funding mechanism is that it
      will only truly be available to wealthier communities. If it is passed, the
      Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) should ensure that lower-income
      communities have more access to statewide resources. \n\n2. Implement road-pricing
      systems that incentivize public transit use\n\nSeveral cities across the United
      States have implemented congestion-pricing schemes. While congestion-pricing
      could be regressive, if implemented here, the region has the opportunity to
      devise a strategy that funnels new money directly to public transit and offers
      exemptions to vehicle-dependent low-income families. \n\n3. Implement low-income
      fares for the MBTA, Commuter Rail and RTAs\n\nThe MBTA could implement a low-income
      fare policy whereby riders pay fares on a sliding scale based on their income.
      Additionally, the MBTA should create a fare-capping program for riders who pay
      per trip, rather than for a daily or monthly pass, and ensure that they don’t
      pay more than the cost of the currently offered passes. \n\n> BEST PRACTICE:
      Bus Rapid Transit Pilots Bus Rapid Transit pilot programs are springing up along
      three key corridors in the MBTA service area. Bus Rapid Transit is often seen
      as a more cost-friendly alternative to building new rail corridors along some
      of our busiest transit routes. Continuing to expand the existing pilot program
      in low-income communities and communities of color could help to address inequities
      in our existing transit system. MAPC will continue to play a role in helping
      the MBTA to determine which corridors should be prioritized and to determine
      the impact of removing parking to accommodate a new dedicated bus lane.  \n\n###
      Adopt equitable decision-making frameworks for transportation planning and project
      development\n\nAn essential part of everyday life for most is travel from home
      to work or to goods and services. The region’s transportation systems is the
      foundation of making commute and utilitarian travel possible and the system
      is sustained through public- and private-sector investment. The transportation
      system that we have is also the result of public- and private-sector planning
      processes, which can tend to focus more heavily on areas that are undergoing
      economic growth and on areas where communities have the capacity to participate
      in decision-making. Since the system serves all in the region, decisions should
      not only favor a few or overly burden specific groups of people, such as households
      of color who are disproportionately burdened by higher transportation costs
      and longer commute times. We can create a more equitable system through greater
      investments in active transportation modes and leading more inclusive planning
      processes. \n\n1. Create and enforce developer mitigation policies that direct
      more funding to walking, biking and public transit infrastructure.\n\nThrough
      the development review process, cities and towns should require developers to
      conduct impact studies and manage congestion impacts by making bicycle, pedestrian
      and transit investments. Legislation to assist municipalities, the MassDOT and
      the MBTA create a framework that would direct (additional) developer mitigation
      funds to support transit service and walking and biking infrastructure would
      ensure that such investments are no longer one-off occurrences and are a regular
      investment from new development, especially in locations that rely more heavily
      on non-vehicular travel for daily travel.\n\n> Emerging Practice: Racial equity
      impact assessments, Racial equity impact assessments analyze the impact of budget
      and policy decisions on racial and ethnic groups and identify ways to mitigate
      the possible consequences of these decisions. They seek to root out bias while
      promoting equity, inclusion, and opportunity. These assessments can be applied
      to any policy or decision making process. King County, Washington created an
      Equity Impact Review (EIR) toolkit for informing more equitable budgets, policies,
      and decision making. The King County Department of Transportation uses it to
      make equitable decisions on service reductions or enhancements. The Parks Department
      uses the EIR to more fairly distribute parks, open space, trails, and Farmer’s
      Market by race, income, and language spoken. The county also applied the EIR
      during the creation of their 2012 budget, which resulted in extra allocations
      to truancy prevention, youth programming in diverse low income areas, and economic
      development opportunities in low income communities.\n \n2. Offer technical
      assistance funding to support design for low-income communities.\n\nThe Transportation
      Improvement Program (TIP) is the process by which federal transportation dollars
      are allocated to cities and towns in Massachusetts. The current scoring criteria
      favorably views projects that advance equity and support environmental justice
      communities, but requires that projects be at 25% design before they are submitted
      to the TIP. This can be a significant cost burden for communities and can create
      a barrier for those communities that already have transit-dependent residents
      or have transit deserts. A program to increase technical assistance to those
      communities to help them reach 25% design could help level the playing field
      for access to federal transportation dollars. \n\n3. Update Project Selection
      Criteria to more holistically consider existing conditions and differences in
      outcomes \n\nTransportation agencies such as Metropolitan Planning Organizations
      (MPOs), and often municipal public works departments, use a set of project evaluation
      criteria to identify priority transportation-related capital investments, given
      constrained financial situations and long range plans. While some progress has
      occurred, many selection criteria continue to prioritize capital and maintenance
      activities that support single occupant automobile travel. \nFortunately, there
      are more resources available that allow consideration of a broader set of factors
      and impacts so that criteria promote more equitable outcomes. MPOs and cities
      and towns can put in place policies that place more emphasis on project characteristics
      such as proximity of high volume roadways to residential and education uses,
      socioeconomic context, and access to employment as well as on estimated project
      outcomes on factors like greenhouse gas emissions, displacement risk, injuries,
      and vegetative cover.\n> \nBEST PRACTICES: Complete Streets, Complete Streets
      are roadways that are safe, accessible and comfortable for all users, regardless
      of age, physical ability, income, or how they choose to travel: by transit,
      on foot, by bike or public transit. Complete Streets increase safety, promote
      economic development, and enhance public safety. MassDOT offers a special funding
      incentive program to cities and towns that adopt Complete Streets policies.
      MAPC has helped many municipalities to write Complete Streets policies and bicycle
      and pedestrian network plans. To date, 70 cities and towns have registered for
      the MassDOT Complete Streets program, with 44% of those cities and towns serving
      populations at or below the median household income.\n"
