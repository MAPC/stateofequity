  anchor: issue-brief
  text: "### Unlocking the potential in all residents\n\nThe Metropolitan Area Planning
    Council (MAPC) released our regional plan, MetroFuture, in 2008, and it envisions
    a sustainable, prosperous and equitable future for the region. Indeed, our region
    enjoys many successes and many residents have seen an improvement in their health,
    education and income. But prosperity in our region and the benefits that accompany
    it have not been enjoyed by all residents of the region.\nBy leaving residents
    behind or overlooking unmet needs, we are holding back the true potential of the
    Metro Boston region and we are failing in our promise to improve the lives of
    everyone who lives and works here. That’s why an equity agenda for policy change
    is needed.\n\n### A Pathway for Greater Prosperity and Dignity\n\nThe 2018 State
    of Equity Policy Agenda provides policy recommendations to address the opportunities
    and disparities identified in the 2017 State of Equity indicators. The agenda
    is not meant to be confined to the work of MAPC, but rather to serve as a tool
    for coalition partners, legislators, municipal officials, policy experts, and
    other interested parties, to think about the ways they can pursue real and meaningful
    change for our communities. \n\n### Equity & MAPC\nMAPC has embraced equity in
    MetroFuture and as a strategic priority. The agency looks to use its unique position
    to help address how the social, natural, and built environment contribute to inequality
    in our region. We believe be doing so that region can join other regions across
    the country that are more equitable and integrated and that have demonstrated
    sustained economic growth. \n\n\n### Policy Change Goals \nThe State of Equity
    Policy Agenda includes the following six goals that, if achieved, will lead to
    greater equity across our region: \n\n1.\tInclusive, diverse communities where
    everyone can afford to live and thrive.\n2.\tConvenient and affordable options
    to access good jobs, schools and recreation.\n3.\tGood jobs and pathways to prosperity.\n4.\tA
    solid foundation in education by offering affordable and quality education, from
    pre-school to college.\n5.\tElimination of conditions and harmful environments
    that leave people sick or injured.\n6.\tA public safety and justice system that
    protects residents of all backgrounds.\n\n### Where we go from here\nThe policy
    agenda is a contribution to ongoing progress that many of our allies and partners
    are already leading. We hope that as an active participant in this shared work,
    especially with those who work tirelessly to address systemic and social barriers,
    we can unlock the potential in all residents of the Metro Boston region.\n"

    have the potential to succeed but that systemic and social barriers prevent such
    success. We make the contribution knowing it represents an ongoing process, one
    in which we look to be an active participant and an ally. We hope through shared
    work we can unlock the potential in all residents of the Metro Boston region.\n\n###

- title: Introduction
  anchor: introduction
  text: "The Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) is the regional planning agency
    serving the people who live and work in the 101 cities and towns of Metropolitan
    Boston. Our mission is to promote smart growth and regional collaboration. Our
    regional plan, MetroFuture, guides our work as we engage the public in responsible
    stewardship of our region’s future. We work toward sound municipal management,
    sustainable land use, protection of natural resources, efficient and affordable
    transportation, a diverse housing stock, public safety, economic development,
    clean energy, healthy communities, an informed public, and equity and opportunity
    among people of all backgrounds.\n\nMAPC believes that achieving equity is paramount
    to the long-term economic and social well-being and sustainable future of the
    Metro Boston region, as well as the entire Commonwealth. \n\n**How do we define
    Equity? \n**Equity is the condition of fair and just inclusion into a society.
    Equity will exist when those who have been most marginalized have equal access
    to opportunities, power, participation and resources and all have avenues to safe,
    healthy, productive, and fulfilling lives. It requires restructuring deeply entrenched
    systems of privilege and oppression that have led to the uneven distribution of
    benefits and burdens over multiple generations. Society will be stronger when
    the promise in all of us is actualized.\n*With inspiration from: Policy Link and
    King County Office of Equity and Social Justice*\n\nIn an equitable region, everyone
    has a chance to grow up healthy, receive a quality education, achieve economic
    security, and enjoy life. An equitable Metro Boston is free from discrimination
    that marginalizes people based on race, sex, religion, disability, national origin,
    immigration status, sexual orientation, gender identify, family or marital status,
    income military status, criminal history or age. It lifts up leaders from marginalized
    groups and focuses on the experiences of the disenfranchised. MAPC is committed
    to seeking to advance equity in the region through our organizational policies,
    planning projects and public policy positions. "

  - title: Building a Roadmap for a More Equitable Region
    anchor: roadmap
    text: "In 2011, MAPC released “The State of Equity in Metro Boston,” an indicators
      report, which provided compelling detail on inequality across many sectors,
      including housing, transportation, public health, and contaminated environments.
      In 2014, MAPC adopted a strategic plan for the agency,[^1] and identified four
      strategic priorities, one of which was to play a leading role in helping the
      region to achieve greater equity. Later that same year, MAPC wrote “The State
      of Equity in Metro Boston: Policy Agenda,”[^2] which recommended policies and
      implementation steps needed to address the disparities highlighted in the 2011
      indicators report. In February 2017, MAPC released a five-year update to the
      State of Equity indicators report, revisiting the 2011 indicators report to
      measure whether the region is moving towards, or away from, the vision for a
      more equitable future in our region. Now, we are releasing an update to the
      2014 Policy Agenda. \n\nThe State of Equity Policy Agenda 2018 is a document
      that provides specific policy recommendations to address the myriad of disparities
      and to sustain the progress discussed in the 2017 State of Equity indicators
      report.[^3] The current political climate at the federal level has become more
      partisan and gridlocked over the past few months. This reinforces the importance
      of equity-focused work at the state and local level.\n\nThe recommendations
      found in this document seek to advance local and regional policy changes to
      eliminate – or at least to reverse – inequalities and inequities that exist
      in our region. Additionally, the Policy Agenda is not intended to be confined
      to the work of MAPC, but rather to serve as a tool for our coalition partners,
      legislators, state and municipal officials, policy experts, and other interested
      parties. We hope it will serve as a roadmap in pursuing real and meaningful
      change for all of our communities. \n\n[^1]:http://www.mapc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Strategic-plan-FINAL-DRAFT-for-Fall-Council-Meeting-10-29-14-2.pdf

  - title: Progress since 2014
    anchor: progress-report
    text: 'In the past few years, Massachusetts has made some strides towards addressing
      inequities. We have passed legislation that protects transgender individuals,
      provides wage fairness and pay equity for women, and we have modestly increased
      the minimum wage. We have increased the Earned Income Tax Credit in order to
      provide a greater refund to low-income families, and we have provided funding
      for programs that aim to curb youth violence. These are all important steps,
      but they are only modest ones. We have much more work to do because we have
      not moved the equity needle far enough. Too many children in Massachusetts wake
      up hungry every day. Home affordability remains impossibly high for many households.
      Low-income families often have to choose among necessities like medicine, food
      and transportation because it’s just too hard to make ends meet. Some of our
      most marginalized residents often have very few options or paths to achieve
      success. And most of our cities, towns and neighborhoods remain segregated by
      race and income. '
  - title: Process to Update the Equity Policy Agenda
    anchor: update-process
    text: "To start the update process for the 2018 policy agenda, our staff reviewed
      the 2014 Agenda to assess the progress made on those initial policy recommendations
      and the best practices that were highlighted in that document. We then invited
      voices from different fields, backgrounds and experiences to participate in
      an Advisory Committee. The Advisors we convened helped us to hone the list of
      issues we most needed to address and clarified the principles we used to create
      the policy agenda. Most importantly, Advisory Committee members assisted us
      in framing the policy suggestions and along with agency staff and representatives,
      provided us with the array of strategies considered for the new policy agenda.
      \n\nThis Policy Agenda will be reviewed and adopted at an upcoming meeting of
      MAPC’s Executive Committee."
- title: 'State of Equity in Metro Boston: Indicators Overview'
  anchor: indicators
  text: |-
    In 2011 MAPC released The State of Equity in Metro Boston, an inventory of cross- sectoral indicators that measured inequity in the region. Those indicators informed the creation of MAPC’s State of Equity Policy Agenda in 2014. MAPC’s 2017 update to the State of Equity indicators report was published in February, 2017 and forms the basis for the agenda put forth in this document. The following section summarizes major findings of the 2017 State of Equity indicators report. Visit the full [State of Equity](http://www.regionalindicators.org/topic_areas/7) report, with many more indicators and insights.

    The indicators suggest that conditions which contribute to inequity are persisting or becoming more severe: discrimination, whether overt or systemic, continues to limit opportunity for residents of color and residents with disabilities; income and wealth disparity is increasing, dimming the prospects for upward mobility; and residential segregation, especially segregation by income, is becoming more severe.
  subsections:
  - title: Diverse yet Segregated
    anchor: diversity
    text: |-
      Metro Boston is becoming more diverse every decade. In 1970, the region’s population was 5% people of color—Asian, Black, Latino, Native American, multiracial and other non-White residents; by 2010, that figure had grown to 28%. MAPC projects that by 2040 the region will be at least 40% people of color. The region has also grown in share of foreign-born residents, and as of 2011-2015, 20% of Metro Boston residents were born outside of the U.S.

      Yet even as it grows more diverse, the region remains racially and economically segregated. The Dissimilarity Index, which measures the extent to which two groups are similarly distributed across the region, has shown decreasing Black to White segregation since 1980. However, Latino to White segregation is now higher than it was in 1990, according to the Index. Economic segregation in the region has been growing more severe since 1990. According to the Neighborhood Income Segregation Index the region’s poorest households are becoming increasingly concentrated into low-income neighborhoods with little income diversity.

      The map in the [Indicators section](http://equityagenda.mapc.org/indicators) of this report, show a change in share of residents of color between 2000 and 2010 by municipality. Although every municipality became more racially and ethnically diverse over this time, the rate of change varied widely. A third of MAPC municipalities became more diverse faster than the region overall. On the other hand, 58 predominantly-White suburban neighborhoods added residents of color more slowly than the region overall.
  - title: Growing up (Un)Healthy
    anchor: health
    text: |-
      In 2011, we found that racial disparities in low birth weight eclipsed differences attributable to education level, most notably for Black women. Based on 2005-2009 data, a college-educated Black woman was 40% more likely to have a low birth weight baby than a White woman without a high school diploma (8.5% among Black women with a college degree, 6.2% among White women with less than a high school degree). In 2017, with more recent data, we found that instances of low birth weight among Black women have declined slightly (from 10.4% in 2005-2009 to 9.4% in 2010-2014 among Black women without a high school degree, and from 8.5% to 7.2% among Black women with a college degree), but the significant preexisting disparity means that those gains have not substantially closed the gap between White women and Black women. The chart below illustrates these disparities.

      Racial health disparities continue into childhood. In fact, in the case of childhood asthma, disparities have become more severe over time. Data from 2008-2012 show a 10% increase in overall youth asthma hospitalizations, compared to data from 2003-2007. This increase was driven by statistically significant increases in Black and Latino youth rates. Black youth in the more recent data experienced a rate of asthma hospitalization 2.7 times higher than the regional average, and climbing. While the rates for Latino youth were closer to the regional average, they increased 22% over the five year interval.
  - title: Narrowing Achievement Gaps
    anchor: education
    text: |-
      The education that a child receives continues to impact them as they move throughout life. Children with early learning opportunities often have better educational outcomes throughout primary school and are then able to attend high achieving high schools, leading to more postsecondary education opportunities.

      Standardized test performance for third graders and tenth graders in Metro Boston improved across almost all demographic categories between 2009 and 2015, and the gains were largest for Black and Latino students. For the 10th Grade Math MCAS, 62 percent of Black and Latino students scored Advanced or Proficient, an increase of 9 percentage points and 7 percentage points, respectively, since 2008-2009. The gap in scores between these groups and White students dropped by 5 points and 3 points, though the gaps remain large, at 26 points. The map below shows the share of students scoring proficient or advanced on the 10th Grade MCAS Math test in the 2014-2015 school year by school district.

      Black and Latino high school students also saw large increases in their four-year graduation rates. Black high school students graduated at a rate of 74% in 2013-2014, up from 68% in 2008-2009; Latino high school students graduated at 70%, up from 62%. These increases, helped to narrow the Black-to-White and Latino-to-White graduation rate gaps. Suspension rates in schools with more than 50% students of color are half of what they were in 2006-2007, though they still remain twice as high as the average for all schools in the region.
  - title: Disparate Prosperity
    anchor: income
    text: |-
      Even as income segregation is growing worse, race is a stronger predictor of where someone will live than income in Metro Boston. When we look at race and income together, we see that people of color live in less-affluent neighborhoods than white households with comparable earnings. A White household in Metro Boston earning $78,000 per year is likely to live in a neighborhood where the median household income of its neighbors is $72,000. Meanwhile, a Black household earning $78,000 is likely to live in a neighborhood where the median income is $51,000. This disparity has increased substantially since 2000.

      At the same time as income segregation is growing, income polarization is increasing. The fifth of Metro Boston households earning the lowest income are making today only 3% more than they were in 2006, while the fifth of households making the most income are making 15% more. The average income for the highest-earning fifth of households ($280,600) is 18 times higher than the average income for the lowest-income fifth of households ($15,800). That disparity has increased by two points since 2006. This can be attributed in part to wage polarization and the decline of the middle class. This polarization disproportionately affects Black and Latino households, whose median household incomes are less than half those of White and Asian households. The map below shows median household income at the census tract level.
  - title: Owning a Home and Building Wealth
    anchor: housing
    text: |-
      Homeownership is one of the cornerstones of building wealth in America. MAPC’s 2011 report found that people of color—even those who earn a substantial income—face continued discrimination in choosing where to live. In particular, high-income applicants (those earning more than $118,000 per year) who are Black are more than twice as likely to be denied a mortgage as high-income borrowers who are White. For Black applicants, the denial rate dropped 4.7 percentage points, and for high-income Latino applicants the denial rate dropped 3.3 percentage points. The chart below shows home purchase loan denial rates for Metro Boston applicants with incomes of $118,000 or more by race and ethnicity.

      While homeownership rates overall have dropped slightly in the last ten years, the declines have been most substantial for Black and Latino householders, whose homeownership rates (32% and 25%, respectively) are less than half of homeownership rates for White householders (68%).
  - title: Participating in the Labor Force
    anchor: employment
    text: Metro Boston’s economy has been growing robustly since the Great Recession,
      and by the end of 2016 Metro Boston’s official unemployment rate was 2.5%, according
      to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). However, not everyone is benefiting
      equally from this growth. The labor force participation rate (the share of the
      working-age population working or looking for a job) for people with only a
      high school degree is 12 percentage points lower than the rate for those with
      a bachelor’s degree, and trending downward. The unemployment rate for Black
      workers is nearly 7 percentage points higher than the rate for White workers,
      and for Latino workers it is nearly 5 points higher. The unemployment rate for
      people with a disability is more than ten percentage points higher than for
      people without a disability. The map below shows the unemployment rate at the
      census tract level.
  - title: Staying out of the System
    anchor: criminal-justice
    text: Inequities in incarceration follow clear socioeconomic and geographic trends
      that carry significant implications for individuals, families, communities,
      and the region. For individuals, encounters with the criminal justice system
      can have long-term impacts on earning power and employability, as well as mental
      and physical health. The number of inmates in Massachusetts Department of Corrections
      (DOC) facilities statewide dropped by 12% from 2010 to 2016, and the disparities
      in incarceration rate for Black and Latino residents also declined, albeit slowly.
      Black and Latino inmates are severely over-represented in DOC facilities. Although
      the state population is 7% Black and 11% Latino, the state’s DOC inmates are
      27% Black and 25% Latino. Native Americans residents, as of 2016, have the highest
      rate of incarceration in the state’s prison system, as shown in the chart.
  - title: Living Longer and Aging in Place
    anchor: senior
    text: As the Baby Boomer generation ages, the region will experience substantial
      growth in the senior population, which may grow by 75% between 2010 and 2030.
      Above-average premature mortality rates for White and Black residents declined
      between 2003-2007 and 2008-2012, while rates for Asian, Latino, and Native American
      residents remained statistically unchanged. Black residents continue to have
      the highest premature mortality rate (348 per 100,000.) Grandparents responsible
      for their grandchildren have a poverty rate of more than 15%, double that of
      grandparents not responsible for their grandchildren. Older adults are more
      housing cost burdened (meaning that they pay more than 30% of their income on
      housing) than younger adults. Nearly 60% of renter households headed by an older
      adult are cost burdened, and more than a third of households where the homeowner
      is an older adult are cost burdened. Despite a 5% drop in the total number of
      housing cost burdened young home owners, the renter and owner housing cost burden
      rates for the elderly remained unchanged between 2005-2009 and 2011-2015.
- title: Guiding Principles for Policy Priorities
  anchor: principles
  text: 'We developed a set of principles to help us highlight a key set of policy
    goals strategies, and related policy strategies and actions, to pursue in the
    next five years. The principles were developed based on input from the project
    Advisory Committee, a review of relevant policy documents (e.g., PolicyLink’s
    All in Cities Toolkit, the Minnesota Legislative Report Card on Racial Equity,
    the City of Seattle’s Equity & Environment Agenda), and MAPC’s ongoing research
    into factors that are at the root of inequalities in Metro Boston. These principles
    operate jointly, rather than as a set of singular ideas, so that we can elevate
    policy approaches that holistically address regional inequities. '
  subsections:
  - title: Lead with Racial Equity
    anchor: racial-equity
    text: "•\tLead with Racial Equity: Our current policies often reflect a system[^6]
      that has been historically biased (e.g., drug enforcement policies). Race has
      been a key, if not the main, bias present in many of the policies that have
      produced the disparities identified in the Metro Boston region. Facing this
      history means that we must push forward changes that counteract past biases
      and that do not deliberately perpetuate policies that are prejudicial. Therefore,
      we seek policy changes that start with a racial equity frame and continue forward
      with recognition of root causes of inequity experienced by other groups. There
      are a number of other biases integrated into our existing policy landscape that
      contribute, directly or indirectly, to discrimination experienced by various
      groups. We believe if these biases are rectified or removed in our policy context,
      we will cultivate a region that includes and support all residents and where
      race and other factors are no longer predictive of economic, health, educational,
      and other outcomes.\n\n[^6]:  System refers to a group of interacting, interrelated,
      or interdependent elements forming a complex whole that typically serve a specific
      purpose and produce a characteristic set of behaviors. Examples include political
      systems, transportation systems and criminal justice systems.\n\n[^7]:\n"
  - title: Embrace Interdisciplinary Approaches
    anchor: interdisciplinary-approaches
    text: "•\tEmbrace Interdisciplinary Approaches: Existing disparities are rarely
      the result of inequities within one system. We support policy changes that weave
      together multiple disciplines,[^7] linking together different experiences and
      knowledge in support of solving common challenges (e.g., education, housing,
      and criminal justice). Several existing and emerging coalitions embrace this
      approach such as those leading the Great Neighborhoods Campaign and the Jobs
      not Jails Campaign. We believe policy changes coming from interdisciplinary
      groups represent the holistic actions necessary to eliminate inequitable outcomes.\n\n[^7]:
      Discipline refers to a branch or domain of knowledge, instruction, or learning.
      Examples include engineering, nursing, public safety, and teaching.\n"
  - title: Work Inside and Outside Existing Systems
    anchor: inside-outsidesystems
    text: "•\tPast policy work shows that incremental changes to existing systems
      can help to address inequalities. However, working within existing systems can
      also allow root causes of inequity and past biases to persist or be perpetuated.
      In order to accelerate the realization of a more equitable region, we look to
      policies that improve and reform existing systems as well as policies that dismantle
      or remove underlying prejudices and practices in order to create more equitable
      conditions."
  - title: Scale Responses to Challenges
    anchor: scale
    text: "•\tPolicy strategies should reflect the scale of challenge and the context
      of the inequality. We believe policies should reflect a necessary level of investment
      (e.g., funding, technical assistance, relief from regulation), at the proper
      scale (e.g., state, regional, municipal), and in the relevant sector (public
      or private, for-profit or non-profit). For example, in some cases, policies
      should empower cities and towns – individually or collectively – to address
      the disparities present in their communities. In other cases, policies will
      need to go beyond municipal boundaries to address causes of inequalities that
      are pervasive across regions and the state."

    text: Crises require immediate responses and we believe individuals in urgent
      need should receive assistance through programmatic and policy responses. At
      the same time, we also recognize crises – immediate and those that become chronic
      - are frequently symptoms of more systemic issues. The crises have root causes
      in our society, emanating from policies, norms, and practices established through
      decades and even centuries. Our policy agenda seeks to blend changes that provide
      short-term relief for individuals affected by crises with longer-term assistance

      We also look for new policy proposals that from the start assess potential inequitable
      effects and remedy those elements prior to passage. Evidence that blends results
      of formal evaluations (e.g., “what works” resources) with lived experiences
      should form the basis of new and updated policies. In this way, we are more
      sure that future actions do not prolong or create harm for those already unfairly
      burdened.

    text: "Metro Boston neighborhoods are becoming more economically segregated and
      racial desegregation lags significantly behind other metropolitan regions. The
      principle drivers of these trends are high housing prices, income disparities,
      and discriminatory lending and renting practices. Our current population and
      housing demand projections estimate that Metro Boston needs to build 435,000
      units of housing – mostly multifamily – between 2010 and 2040 to meet increasing
      demand and maintain current affordability. Unfortunately, we are falling far
      short, meaning that our region is becoming increasingly unaffordable for families.
      Families are increasingly cost-burdened in our region, spending well over 30%
      of their income on housing.[^8] \n\nSince 2012, the rate of cost burden has
      been trending up for the renter population and down for the homeowner population.
      The trend indicates a growing housing cost burden gap between homeowners and
      renters, increasing the vulnerability of the region’s renters who are disproportionately
      people of color. Neighborhoods with a high concentration of cost-burdened residents,
      especially renters, are at risk of rapid population turnover when housing costs
      rise even slightly or when these households face economic setbacks. Tempering
      the rising cost of housing will be a critical step in ensuring that the earnings
      of Metro Boston residents are sufficient to enable them to make a home and remain
      financially stable. Of course, housing costs are only one side of the equation;
      job opportunities and growing wages are also essential, as discuss further below. \nAt
      the same time, policies that encourage affordability do not necessarily promote
      inclusiveness. As neighborhoods change – physically, economically, socially
      – we can take steps that protect diversity and create welcoming environments.
      Likewise, places can grow stronger and more resilient by accommodating people
      with a mixture of unique perspectives and experiences. Integrating new people
      while honoring those who have been part of a place history does require intention.
      Policies provide a framework for how the state and cities and towns can manage
      a changing environment while providing an opportunity for all to benefit from
      inclusiveness.\n\n### i.\tProtect tenants, increase the supply of homes that
      low-and middle-income families can afford to buy, and help all residents stay
      where they live\n\nThe lack of affordable housing options in Metro Boston negatively
      impacts the region’s ability to house our economically and ethnically diverse
      residential base and to support a thriving economy. Half the region’s renters
      and 30% of homeowners are cost burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of
      their annual household income on housing. Policy responses to the affordability
      crisis include preserving the existing affordable housing supply, increasing
      the stock of housing, both affordable and market rate, and ensuring that below
      market-rate units are occupied by households with corresponding incomes. Special
      attention must be paid to ensuring that adequate and affordable housing is available
      for families with children, seniors downsizing from larger homes, and people
      with disabilities – all populations that historically have limited housing choices.\n\n1.
      Pass comprehensive zoning reform in order to encourage affordable housing production
      and eliminate discriminatory zoning practices.\n\nMassachusetts has a long history
      of residential segregation, which can be traced in large part to restrictive
      local zoning and permitting decisions, as well as discriminatory real estate
      and lending practices. Comprehensive zoning reform in Massachusetts must promote
      inclusive neighborhoods where families with children and households with low-or-moderate
      incomes can find homes.\n\nMassachusetts has not comprehensively updated its
      core zoning and subdivision laws in several decades. Municipalities across the
      Commonwealth use existing zoning laws as a way to prevent changes that would
      allow more affordable homes, condominiums, and apartments. An update to the
      Commonwealth’s outdated zoning laws should ensure that most cities and towns
      will allow at least some districts where multi-family housing can be built,
      while encouraging municipalities to adopt bylaws or ordinances that ensure at
      least a portion of this housing will be deed-restricted affordable. Both of
      these tools will help to increase housing type diversity and affordability in
      Metro Boston and across the Commonwealth.\n\n1. Provide additional funds for
      preservation and production of affordable homes and continue to fund existing
      smart-growth incentive zoning.\n\nTo meaningfully address our state’s housing
      crisis, we have to dedicate greater resources to preserving and producing affordable
      homes. Some particularly important elements of our housing production system
      include adequate funding for the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, the Affordable
      Housing Trust Fund, the Housing Innovation Fund, and the Massachusetts Rental
      Voucher Program. Adequate funds for the modernization of public housing are
      essential. The state should continue to fund the Commonwealth’s smart growth
      incentive programs under Chapters 40R and 40S, so that cities and towns can
      implement smart growth zoning overlays and feel confident that when they do,
      any possible impacts on school capacity will be meaningfully offset by state
      funding.[^9]\n\n> Emerging Practice: Managing Neighborhood Change[^10] \nLower-income
      households are disproportionately impacted by residential market inflation resulting
      from neighborhood investment, including increased housing cost burden and the
      risk of displacement, that are associated with new investment in housing, businesses,
      and infrastructure. Managing Neighborhood Change (MNC) is a data- and community-driven
      analysis and visioning process that engages residents in a community dialogue
      around neighborhood change, including what is welcome and what is cause for
      concern. MNC draws on housing and demographic data, in addition to resident
      experiences, to provide strategies that mitigate the risks of change and more
      equitably distribute the benefits of new investments. \n\n1. Pass legislation
      aimed at increasing protections for renters.\n\nLegislation that would give
      tenants a right to counsel in eviction proceedings, require just-cause evictions,
      protect paying tenants when a home is foreclosed or sold for a tax lien, and
      offer tenants the right of first refusal in the event that their property is
      sold are modest steps that would help reduce housing insecurity. When tenants
      are defended by counsel in court proceedings, they are more likely to remain
      in their homes. Just-cause eviction laws protect tenants from unfair or discriminatory
      evictions, while a right of first refusal would give tenants an opportunity
      to purchase or assign their right to purchase a property, thereby increasing
      housing stability. \nAdditionally, we should pass legislation that would give
      a tax credit to landlords who rent at below-market rates, helping to incentivize
      these landlords to maintain rents that are affordable, especially for low- and
      moderate-income tenants, and to protect neighborhoods from the effects of inflation.
      Also, tenants generally lack any protection against eviction when the home in
      which they are living is foreclosed, or when a municipality sells the property
      for tax collection – even if the tenant is up to date on her rent. Protections
      in such instances are essential ways for the tenant’s housing circumstances
      to remain stable, even if the underlying property is undergoing a change of
      ownership.\n\n>Best Practice: Housing First Initiative \n\nHousing First is
      an approach that provided immediate access to permanent housing for individuals
      and families who are experiencing homelessness. By contrast to approaches that
      seek to graduate people who are homeless through short-term housing and treatment,
      the Housing First approach provides permanent housing with out preconditions
      and includes supportive services (e.g., medication management, counseling).
      Research has provided strong evidence that the combination of immediate access
      to permanent housing and to supportive services has reduced homelessness.[^11]
      In addition, there is strong evidence that the approach reduces hospitalizations
      for those who are homeless and have mental illnesses and substance use disorders.
      Currently, both public sector agencies and hospital systems are making investments
      into housing stability using the Housing First approach as model. Examples include
      Housing First Initiative Programs run by the Homeless Services Bureau of the
      Boston Public Health Commission[^12] and the housing-focused Community Health
      Initiative of Boston Medical Center.[^13] \n\n1. Facilitate affordable housing
      production for a range of low-income households.\n\nCurrently, most affordable
      housing requirements are aimed at households with incomes at 80% of the area
      median or below. As a result, the majority of new units are affordable to households
      with incomes closest to that ceiling. The area median income (AMI) for a four-person
      household in the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) for Metro Boston is $103,400.
      The MSA is an area so geographically large that it includes municipalities in
      Middlesex, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Plymouth Counties, and even parts of
      New Hampshire. High wealth suburbs in the MSA drive up our region’s AMI, which
      ultimately means that most deed-restricted affordable units are not actually
      within financial reach of many in need in Metro Boston. Moreover, very low-income
      (30-50% of AMI) and extremely low-income (30% of AMI and below) working households
      are growing in number and as a share of the region’s population. To address
      the increasing need within the context of an elevated AMI, affordable housing
      requirements should be adjusted to include a portion of homes for those with
      incomes between 50% and 80% of the AMI, between 30% and 50%, and even 30% and
      below. \n\n### ii.\tEnsure residents with low incomes, people of color, and
      other protected classes have access to homes that suit their needs. \n\nDiscriminatory
      practices still limit homeownership. For instance, high-income applicants who
      are Black or Latino are denied a mortgage at rates that are 7-to-12 percentage
      points higher than applicants who are white and of similar economic status. Since
      homeownership gaps play a key role in the nation’s widening racial wealth gap,[^14] the
      racial disparities in Metro Boston homeownership rates and home loan denial
      rates are limiting the capacity of Metro Boston residents of color and their
      municipalities to build wealth. \n\n1. Continue to enforce the Affirmatively
      Furthering Fair Housing rule.\nThe rule, promulgated under the Obama administration,
      required that jurisdictions that receive federal housing funding not only document
      barriers to integration and opportunity, but also detail and prioritize policies
      to eradicate these barriers. The Trump Administration has delayed implementation
      of this rule, and indicated they have no intention to read any plans currently
      submitted until 2020. But the main purpose of these plans – to help local governments
      to understand and eliminate discriminatory practices – remains as important
      as ever. At the local level, cities and towns should continue moving forward
      to develop Assessments of Fair Housing, and MAPC will continue to assist them
      both to develop these plans and to implement their recommendations.\n\n1. Prioritize
      housing stock diversity across Massachusetts communities.\n\nAcross our region,
      small single-family homes are being torn down and replaced with larger, more
      expansive single-family properties. The new homes are generally higher priced
      and are not viable options for low- and moderate-income would-be homeowners.
      At the same time, developers of new, multi-family residential developments often
      disregard guidelines that encourage a bedroom mix inclusive of 3-bedroom units,
      instead opting to build studio, one- and two-bedroom units, which limits opportunities
      for displaced families seeking homes in gentrifying  neighborhoods. Local legislative
      action should request that a range of home sizes be provided through redevelopment
      or limit replacement to similar footprints. These actions may help minimize
      the impact of teardowns on neighborhoods. In addition, municipalities should
      encourage development of smaller single-family homes, multi-family units in
      smart growth locations and the opportunity for accessory dwelling units (ADUs)
      that make homes more accessible, especially to those with limited incomes, aging
      residents, and people with disabilities.\n\n> BEST PRACTICE FOR MUNIS: Community
      Engagement and Outreach.\nPlanning processes should include significant community
      engagement and outreach to include participation from older adults, persons
      with disabilities, people of color, immigrants, people for whom English is not
      their primary language, and women.\n \nFor example, equitable community engagement
      was a critical component of efforts to build on the Vision for Downtown Lynn.
      MAPC partnered with the city of Lynn to convene a project team of advisors,
      conducted interviews with community leaders, gave presentations to community-based
      organizations, attended community events, talked with people we encountered
      on the street or at local businesses, interacted with community members using
      social media such as Facebook as well as via email, collected land use and property
      data using local volunteers, and hosted two public forums downtown. It is often
      unfeasible to get input from every single resident, but this targeted approach
      provided an informed perspective to guide planning recommendations.\n\n### iii.
      Ensure that our communities are inclusive, representative and democratic \n\nIn
      order for residents living in Metro Boston to thrive and contribute to their
      fullest, they must feel a sense of inclusivity, belonging, and control. We must
      preserve and protect rights for all of the residents in our Commonwealth. For
      example, we must ensure that voting continues to be a right, preserved by removing
      barriers to voter registration and encouraging participation in municipal elections.\nWe
      also live in a time when current federal immigration policies exclude and ostracize
      immigrants, reducing opportunities for them to civically engage, and putting
      the onus on local governments to enforce and enact policies to make immigrants
      feel safe and welcome. Undocumented immigrants create incredible value, enhancing
      the rich culture of our region and adding to our workforce and economic development.
      \n\n1. Enact automatic voter registration throughout Massachusetts\n\nAutomatic
      voter registration enables a government agency, usually the Registry of Motor
      Vehicles, to automatically register a citizen upon state license or ID issuance
      or renewal, unless the person declines to do so. The citizen’s information is
      then sent to the appropriate election office for verification of voting eligibility.
      Currently, nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted automatic voter
      registration policies, as they serve to increase voter registration rates and
      help to eliminate existing barriers to voter registration. \n\n1. Make Massachusetts
      a sanctuary state.\n\nFederal law bars state and local agencies or officials
      from restricting the transmission of information regarding the immigration status,
      lawful or unlawful, of any individual.[^15] Sanctuary state legislation could
      take several different forms, but at its core, it would prohibit state and local
      resources from being used to enforce immigration laws that are the responsibility
      of the federal government, even while the state and municipalities comply completely
      with federal law. It could also go further to prevent law enforcement officers
      from inquiring about an individual’s immigration status unless it is pertinent
      to the crime at issue or further limit federal Immigration, Customs and Enforcement
      (ICE) agents from accessing information on booking lists or release dates unless
      a person is serving a sentence for a serious violent felony. Ensuring that our
      state continues to foster trust among and remain welcoming to all residents,
      regardless of where they come from or the circumstances of their arrival, is
      vital to the long-term economic and social wellbeing of the entire Commonwealth.
      \  \n\n> BEST PRACTICE: Create a process that allows non-citizen immigrants
      to vote in municipal elections\n\nAcross the country, several municipalities
      or counties have allowed non-citizen residents to vote in municipal elections,
      under the theory that all residents should be involved in municipal service
      delivery. Historically, until 1926, 40 states allowed non-citizens to vote in
      municipal and state elections, a policy that was reversed as nativist sentiments
      rose in the United States. There is no federal law that makes it illegal for
      cities and towns to give non-citizens the right to vote, and currently, a number
      of cities in Maryland as well as the cities of Chicago and San Francisco provide
      options for non-citizen residents to participate in municipal elections.\n\n1.
      Cultivate competency for service provision to residents who are lesbian, gay,
      bisexual, transgender, and queer.\n\nAs a just and fair society, we seek and
      use approaches that allow for greater inclusion. In Metro Boston and Massachusetts,
      there are policy actions that can foster greater inclusion and responsiveness
      to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) residents. This includes
      partnering with representatives of the LGBTQ community to build capacity among
      public and private service providers for greater cultural competency. An example
      of such a proposal is the An Act Relative to LGBT Awareness Training for Aging
      Services Provider, which would support development of a training program for
      the delivery of accessible and appropriate services to LGBTQ older adults and
      their caregivers. This act would prevent older LGBTQ residents from any need
      to hide their identity and receive care that is relevant and respectful.\n\n1.
      Reverse exclusionary practices in zoning, permitting, real estate sales, and
      mortgage lending.\n \nMassachusetts continues to struggle with high levels of
      racial, ethnic and income segregation, a legacy of many years of public and
      private actions. We must recognize that restrictive local zoning and permitting
      decisions are a contributing factor to this persistent segregation, often limiting
      the development of both deed-restricted and market rate affordable units, especially
      for families with children. Real estate and finance practices often have the
      additional impact of making it difficult for low-income households and people
      of color to purchase homes, even when they could otherwise qualify to do so.
      Massachusetts must clarify that such practices are a violation of state law,
      and must take stronger steps to advance fair housing throughout the state.\n\n[^8]:

  - title: We have convenient and affordable options to access good jobs, schools
      and recreation
    anchor: affordability
    text: "Metro Boston’s residents depend on the region’s transportation system to
      connect them to school, work, services, and recreational activities. Despite
      the many ways residents of the region get around, transportation improvements
      have tended to promote one form of travel – driving alone – rather than emphasizing
      access to destinations regardless of how a person travels. As a result, many
      residents face substantial challenges when commuting to work or school, getting
      to the doctor’s office, or visiting friends. This is especially true for low-income
      households who do not own or cannot afford a vehicle, young people and older
      adults who cannot drive, and people with mobility impairments. Those individual
      and household constraints are compounded by historical and ongoing disparities
      in transit service available for low-income communities and communities of color.[^8],[^9]\n \n###
      Expand transportation options, particularly for underserved populations and
      communities of color, and decrease transportation costs for cost-burdened households.\n\nThe
      region’s commuters of color spend more time commuting than their White counterparts.
      Without a range of convenient transportation options, particularly public transit
      and safe pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, marginalized communities have
      limited mobility options and yet are likely to experience disproportionate impacts
      from vehicular emissions. These same communities often spend a disproportionate
      percentage of their household incomes on transportation costs. As MBTA, Commuter
      Rail and event Regional Transit costs continue to rise, we have seen a steady
      decrease in the real dollar value of the gas tax since 1996. Equitable transportation
      means providing a range of travel options to low-income communities and communities
      of color, all of which are affordable, reliable, safe and sustainable.  \n \n1.
      Enact Regional Transportation Ballot Initiatives to support active transportation
      investments\n\nThis legislation would allow a municipality or group of municipalities
      to raise additional local money for transportation projects via a ballot initiative,
      giving voters a more direct role in the transportation funding process and creating
      a lock box of funds for specific investments. In many communities across our
      region, we expect that these funds would be used to create alternative transportation
      investments, or to increase investments in the existing system, particularly
      in areas that are underserved by transit or active transportation options. \n\n2.
      Implement road-pricing systems that incentivize public transit use\n\nSeveral
      cities across the United States, including Minneapolis, Housing and San Diego
      have implemented congestion-pricing schemes. If implemented here, we have the
      opportunity to devise a strategy that funnels new money directly to public transit
      and offers financial exemptions to vehicle-dependent low-income families.[^10]\n\n3.
      Implement low-income fares for the MBTA, Commuter Rail and RTAs\n\nThe MBTA
      could implement a low-income fare policy whereby riders pay fares on a sliding
      scale based on their income. Additionally, the MBTA should create a fare-capping
      program for riders who pay per trip, rather than for a daily or monthly pass,
      and ensure that they don’t pay more than the cost of the currently offered passes.\n\n>
      BEST PRACTICE: Bus Rapid Transit Pilots Bus Rapid Transit pilot programs are
      springing up along three key corridors in the MBTA service area. Bus Rapid Transit
      is often seen as a more cost-friendly alternative to building new rail corridors
      along some of our busiest transit routes. Continuing to expand the existing
      pilot program in low-income communities and communities of color could help
      to address inequities in our existing transit system. MAPC will continue to
      play a role in helping the MBTA to determine which corridors should be prioritized
      and to determine the impact of removing parking to accommodate a new dedicated
      bus lane.\n\n### Adopt equitable decision-making frameworks for transportation
      planning and project development\n\nAn essential part of everyday life for most
      is travel from home to work, school, shopping, services, or recreation. The
      region’s transportation system is the foundation of making travel possible,
      and the system is sustained mainly through public investment. The transportation
      system that we have is also the result of the public sector planning process,
      which can tend to focus more heavily on areas that are undergoing economic growth
      and on areas where communities have the capacity to participate in decision-making.
      Since the system serves all in the region, decisions should not only favor a
      few or overly burden specific groups of people, such as households of color
      who are disproportionately burdened by higher transportation costs and longer
      commute times.[^11] We can create a more equitable system by leading with more
      inclusive planning processes, greater investments in active transportation modes,
      improvement to all elements of the public transit system (rail, subway, and
      bus), and ensuring investments in under-served communities (low-income communities
      not well served by transit, as well as rural and less development areas in need
      of greater connectivity and improved mobility.\n\n1. Create and enforce developer
      mitigation policies that direct more funding to walking, biking and public transit
      infrastructure.\n\nThrough the development review process, the Commonwealth
      and municipalities should require developers to conduct impact studies, providing
      appropriate mitigation for project impacts, and helping to manage congestion.
      \ Such investments should include those that improve transit, bicycle, and pedestrian
      options, in addition to appropriate roadway improvements. Statues, regulations,
      and guidelines can help MassDOT, the MBTA, and Regional Transit Authorities
      to ensure that such investments are no longer one-off occurrences, but rather
      are a regular type of investment, especially in locations that rely more heavily
      on non-vehicular modes for daily travel.\n\n> Emerging Practice: Racial equity
      impact assessments, Much attention has been paid to ways of improving project
      selection criteria used by the Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) for
      federal transportation dollars, and by the Commonwealth for state funds.  We
      have made progress to ensure that funding goes to projects in Environmental
      Justice communities as well as areas ill-served by transit, but additional consideration
      should be given to assessing projects by using “accessibility standards,” which
      focus on the ability of transportation improvements to help people from various
      parts of the region to access job and educational opportunities.  Such standards
      could unify various constituencies in the region who need better access to jobs
      and schools, from lower-income urban residents, to isolated immigrant communities,
      and rural residents of outlying areas.[^12]\n \n2. Offer technical assistance
      funding to support design for low-income communities.\n\nThe Transportation
      Improvement Program (TIP) is the process by which federal transportation dollars
      are allocated to cities and towns in Massachusetts. The current scoring criteria
      favorably view projects that advance equity and support environmental justice
      communities, but requires that projects be at 25% design before they are submitted
      to the TIP. This can be a significant cost burden for communities and can create
      a barrier for those communities that already have transit-dependent residents
      or have transit deserts. It can also be a barrier for smaller, rural, or more
      outlying communities facing severe budget challenges.  A program to increase
      technical assistance to such communities to help them reach 25% design could
      help to level the playing field for access to federal transportation dollars.
      \n\n3. Update Project Selection Criteria to consider existing conditions and
      differences in outcomes in a more holistic manner.\n\nMuch attention has been
      paid to ways of improving project selection criteria used by the Metropolitan
      Planning Organizations (MPOs) for federal transportation dollars, and by the
      Commonwealth for state funds.  We have made progress to ensure that funding
      goes to projects in Environmental Justice communities as well as areas ill-served
      by transit, but additional consideration should be given to assessing projects
      by using “accessibility standards,” which focus on the ability of transportation
      improvements to help people from various parts of the region to access job and
      educational opportunities.  Such standards could unify various constituencies
      in the region who need better access to jobs and schools, from lower-income
      urban residents, to isolated immigrant communities, and rural residents of outlying
      areas.\n\n> BEST PRACTICES: Complete Streets, Complete Streets are roadways
      that are safe, accessible and comfortable for all users, regardless of age,
      physical ability, income, or how they choose to travel: by transit, on foot,
      by bike or public transit. Complete Streets increase safety, promote economic
      development, and enhance public safety. MassDOT offers a special funding incentive
      program to cities and towns that adopt Complete Streets policies. MAPC has helped
      many municipalities to write Complete Streets policies and bicycle and pedestrian
      network plans. To date, 70 cities and towns have registered for the MassDOT
      Complete Streets program, with 44% of those cities and towns serving populations
      at or below the median household income.\n\n[^8]:Cairns, S., Greig, J., & Wachs,

  - title: We have good jobs and pathways to prosperity.
    anchor: report-prosperity
    text: "While the Metro Boston’s regional economy has been growing robustly since
      the Great Recession, not everyone has benefitted equally from that growth. Participation
      rates for people with a high school degree are 12 percentage points lower than
      the rates for those with a bachelor’s degree, and trending downward. The unemployment
      rate for workers who are Black is nearly 7 percentage points higher than the
      rate for workers who are White, and the Latino rate is nearly 5 points higher.
      The unemployment rate for people with a disability is more than 10 percentage
      points higher than for people without a disability. \n\nA good job can be defined
      as employment that respects workers’ rights, provides opportunity for upward
      mobility, ensures safe working conditions, pays a living wage, is free from
      any type of discrimination or harassment, and provides meaningful benefits.
      Well-paying jobs represent the difference between economic security and financial
      instability, and studies show that good jobs have a direct tie to educational
      attainment opportunities among families and the ability to live in healthier
      homes and neighborhoods.[^13] \n\nMAPC’s work on income inequality seeks to
      advance policies that improve the economic vitality of all by supporting financial
      independence for residents, beginning with those who have the greatest economic
      needs in our region.[^14]\n\n### i.\tRemove barriers to employment\nIn the Metro
      Boston, workers without college degrees, communities of color, and workers with
      a disability are disproportionately under-employed and unemployed. Many workplace
      policies continue to put up artificial barriers for employees in these demographics.
      Policy shifts could have a profound impact on employees who are often underpaid
      and working in inflexible situations. Additionally, Criminal Offender Record
      Information (CORI) forms continue to be a barrier for individuals who enter
      or return to the workforce after a criminal case. It is not only an employment
      barrier, but can also limit an individual’s eligibility for certain state assistance
      programs and their economic independence and socio-economic mobility. More attention
      is paid to CORI reform under the goal. \n\n1. Paid Family and Medical Leave\n\nA
      current proposal in the Legislature would allow employees who are eligible under
      the current Massachusetts Parental Leave Act and federal Family and Medical
      Leave Act to take paid time off to recover from a serious illness or injury,
      to care for a seriously ill or injured family member, or to care for a new child.
      If passed, the legislation would provide critical financial security for employees
      who need to serve as a caretaker, extend the length of leave available to employees,
      and ensure that workers can keep their jobs once they return from leave. \n\nPaid
      Family and Medical Leave has the potential to improve outcomes particularly
      for women, minority and low-wage workers. These populations are less likely
      to receive wage replacement when they take time off to attend to a personal
      illness or to care for a family member;[^15] they are also more likely to cut
      back on spending, dip into savings, and apply for public assistance since they
      cannot go without pay,.[^16],[^17] Employees without paid leave are also more
      likely to leave the workforce, which stifles professional growth and exacerbates
      wage inequality.[^18]\n\n1. Increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour, and tie
      the increase to inflation\n\nUnder the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the
      federal minimum wage for covered non-exempt employees is $7.25 per hour effective
      July 24, 2009. Many states also have minimum wage laws. Where an employee is
      subject to both the state and federal minimum wage laws, the employee is entitled
      to the higher minimum wage rate. The minimum wage in Massachusetts is set at
      $11.00 per hour.[^19]\n\nThe declining value of the minimum wage is one of the
      primary causes of wage inequality between low and middle-income workers. The
      minimum wage should be increased to $15 an hour over a reasonable period of
      time, and it should be tied to the consumer price index thereafter to ensure
      that wages remain stable. In addition, the state should require companies to
      pay tipped worker $15 an hour and create exceptions to the minimum wage law
      to allow for an adjusted wage for employees between the ages of 16 and 18.\n\n>
      BEST PRACTICE: Improve technical employment opportunities for women and people
      of color\nWomen and people of color are under-represented in the fields of Science,
      Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) and in the construction industry. Many
      of the Commonwealth’s newest jobs are in the technology field, but we need to
      create a greater talent pipeline between educational institutions and the workforce.
      Many programs throughout the Commonwealth provide mentoring opportunities for
      young women interested in STEM and Building Trade Skills and we should better
      connect employers to these potential employees. Additionally workforce development
      training opportunities should be located near transit and should have flexible
      childcare opportunities.   \n\nIn July 2017, Governor Baker signed the Pregnant
      Workers Fairness Act, which prohibits workplace and hiring discrimination related
      to pregnancy and nursing and requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations
      for expectant and new mothers in the workplace. \n\nIn December 2017, Boston
      City Council signed an Ordinance on Equity in Opportunity for City Contracting,
      which mandates active outreach to businesses owned by people of color and women,
      it requires all requests for proposals issued by the City of Boston include
      a rating of diversity and inclusion plans as evaluation criteria, and it creates
      a quarterly reporting requirement so that city government can hold themselves
      accountable.\n\n### ii.\tIncrease access to business ownership and employment/financial
      independence\n\n\nSmall business creation is usually heralded as an opportunity
      for Americans to pursue their entrepreneurial spirit and provide jobs for their
      community. Unfortunately access to state and local resources to start a business
      are not necessarily available to everyone. Whether prospective entrepreneurs
      face bank loan discrimination, speak a foreign language, face difficulties with
      talent retention or lack financial resources, the region needs to do more to
      increase local business ownership. We must incentivize the creation of small
      businesses and support objectives aimed at worker development.\n\n1. Recapitalize
      the Workforce Competitiveness Trust Fund\n\nThe Workforce Competitiveness Trust
      Fund, operated out of the Commonwealth Corporation, invests in programs that
      train and place unemployed or underemployed workers. Between 2007 and 2011,
      the Fund supported 31 partnerships, serving more than 6,700 youth and adults.[^20]
      The Fund supports individuals who might rely on public benefits, have health
      problems or disabilities, or who haven’t completed school. The Fund provides
      support to residents for employment opportunities, but works with Massachusetts
      businesses to secure employees. The fund used to receive $18 million but its
      funding has dipped in recent years and was just $1 million on the FY18 budget.
      The legislature should fully fund this important program and restore its previous
      funding levels.\n\n1. Technical assistance programs and revolving loan funds
      that provide access to capital for small businesses\n\nMassachusetts established
      the Small Business Technical Assistance (SBTA) program in 2006 in order to help
      small businesses succeed in underserved communities in the commonwealth, particularly
      low- to moderate-income communities and communities of color. The program provides
      funding to not-for-profit grantees, largely consisting of Community Development
      Corporations (CDCs) or Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs),
      who then offer a range of technical assistance (TA) and financial services to
      small business clients. The entrepreneurial and employment opportunities supported
      by the SBTA program helps reduce deeply entrenched economic disparities that
      put traditionally underserved populations at risk for worse economic and health
      outcomes. This program should be funded with an investment of at least $2 million.\n\n1.
      Technical assistance and small business development programs for worker-owned
      cooperatives\n\nWorker-owned cooperatives are companies owned and managed by
      employees who share decision-making powers and who control the profits produced
      through their labor. According to a recent study, about 60 percent of new cooperatives
      worker-owners since 2010 are people of color and nearly 70% are women.[^21]
      \ Cooperatives provide an alternative to traditional corporations in many regards
      not least of which is that profits remain with the worker-owners and more likely
      in the surrounding community. The state and municipalities can help cooperatives
      form by establishing a startup or bridge financing program (e.g., revolving
      loan fund) that includes technical assistance or space that helps the cooperatives
      establish themselves.\n\n### iii.\tFacilitate intergenerational wealth transfer
      among low- and middle-income families\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank
      of Boston’s 2015 Report titled The Color of Wealth, “Nonwhite households have
      only a fraction of the net worth attributed to white households. While white
      households have a median wealth of $247,500, Dominicans and U.S. blacks have
      a median wealth of close to zero. Of all nonwhite groups for which estimates
      could be made, Caribbean black households have the highest median wealth with
      $12,000, which is only 5 percent of the wealth attributed to white households
      in the Boston MSA [Metropolitan Statistical Area].”[^22]\n\nThis economic data
      demonstrates that barriers to employment and business ownership, as well as
      homeownership, have real consequences on an individual’s ability to save money,
      own assets and pass them on to their families. We must pass legislation and
      support programs that facilitate low-income and middle-income households to
      accumulate wealth and assets. \n\n1. Increase the Earned Income Tax Credit and
      expand its eligibility.\n\nThe Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a benefit
      to working families earning low- to moderate-incomes (individuals earning less
      than $15,000; families with children earning less than $50,000).[^23] The EITC
      should be increased, so that more people can take advantage of this important
      benefit. Research shows that the EITC has increased employment, boosting long-term
      earnings and future retirement benefits.[^24] The benefit should also be expanded
      to include individuals who meet the income requirements but don’t have children,
      and should be based on personal instead of family income.\n\n1. Pass legislation
      aimed at curbing the “Cliff Effect” for individuals and families receiving state
      benefits\n\nThe “Cliff Effect” occurs when an individual or family receiving
      state benefits sees a sharp decline in those benefits as income increases. While
      many state benefit programs currently have an income or employment requirement,
      benefits generally decrease as income increases. The unintended result is either
      a disincentive toward economic mobility or a person working harder, with less
      financial stability. Program assistance should be tapered as individuals or
      families increase their incomes, rather than cutting off assistance at particular
      income levels. The state should also pass legislation that lifts the welfare
      benefit cap for families who have a child while receiving state assistance.
      Massachusetts is one of only 17 states that still have a cap on children conceived
      while a family is receiving welfare assistance. The family cap excludes approximately
      9,400 children in Massachusetts, and this has a tremendous impact on the health
      and welfare of those children and their families.[^25]\n\n> BEST PRACTICE: Improve
      financial literacy programs for low-income households\n\nIn 2016, Mayor Toni
      Harp of New Haven launched the Financial Empowerment Commission with the vision
      of building financial stability and knowledge amongst New Haven low income residents.
      This initiative was enabled by a planning grant called the “Next Generation
      Financial Empowerment Grant” from the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund
      (CFE Fund).  To develop recommendations, the Mayor appointed a community advisory
      group to the collect and share insights on the financial lives of New Haven
      residents. Based on the findings from the advisory group, the commission chose
      two target populations that would most benefit from financial empowerment interventions.
      \n•\tLow- wage households earning less than 200% of the federal poverty guidelines,
      and focus on those earning less than 100% of the guidelines.  \n•\tThe re- entry
      of formerly incarcerated individuals into the community. \nThe Commission was
      tasked with drafting recommendations for a strategic plan identifying short
      and long term goals and implementation strategies. The recommendations included
      building a financial empowerment network with community based organizations
      to connect and identify individuals in the target populations and referring
      them to services and resources. Also, creating a Financial Empowerment Center
      that would be staffed with a full-time financial coach/ counselor. With these
      recommendations the Mayor and Commission hope to foster a culture of financial
      empower for both the target populations and all residents of New Haven.\n\n1.
      Enact Tenant First Right to Purchase Options for Multi-Family Buildings\n\nResidents
      can experience displacement as residential buildings are sold to new ownership.
      This can be particularly harmful for properties that have provide affordable
      homes for households earning low- and moderate-incomes. A Tenant First Right
      Purchase Option protection, when adopted by a municipality, would stipulate
      that owners of residential properties must provide current tenants an chance
      to purchase the property at a fair market price and terms before the owner can
      transfer the property to a third party. When coupled with a low-interest loans,
      the first right purchase option provides an avenue to homeownership, and wealth
      creation, for low- and moderate-income families.\n\n[^13]:MAPC Regional Indicators,

  - title: We unlock the potential in our children by providing affordable and quality
      education
    anchor: report-education
    text: "In Massachusetts, we place a high value on learning and education. We have
      prospered in large part due to our high levels of educational performance and
      public and private academic institutions. While many have benefited from the
      lifelong learning opportunities found in our region, not all do. Many of our
      students of color, students with disabilities, and students from low-income
      households face challenges in meeting educational achievement goals and graduating
      from high school. Consequently, we have set these children, teenagers, and adults
      on a path that narrows their chances to reach their full potential and that
      perpetuates inequalities in our region. Since a person with a college degree
      has a much greater chance of being employed and be compensated nearly double
      the amount as a person without a college degree,[^28] earnings and economic
      independence are highly related to educational attainment, we limit their prosperity
      and a substantial return on investment to the region. There is a considerable
      amount of work and change necessary to provide quality learning opportunities
      for the people who are in most need and facing the greatest disparities.\n \n###
      i.\tProvide children with supportive learning environments from birth\n\nResearch
      shows that children who start school ready to learn have better educational
      outcomes throughout primary school and are then able to achieve greater success
      in high school. Readiness to learn begins even before students enter elementary
      and secondary education as an infant’s health and environment is closely associated
      with the health and socioeconomic characteristics of its birth parents. It is
      linked as well with the health status of mothers who may be more prone to pre-term
      and low birth weight births when exposed to social and environmental stressors.
      Therefore, policy action can supply parents and children most in need with support
      from pregnancy through early childhood to improve lifelong outcomes.\n\n1. Increase
      funding for Head Start programs\n\nOur congressional delegation should build
      on their commitment to early education by increasing their support for the federally
      funded Head Start program.  Over the past 50 years, Head Start has provided
      comprehensive early education and support services in the areas of health and
      dental care, nutrition, special education, parent skill workshops and social
      services for children ages three to five and their families. We recommend an
      increase in funding not only so more children can benefit, but also to develop
      and retain a quality workforce. \n\n1. Pass legislation to fund Universal Pre-K\n\nLegislation
      has been filed to help close the achievement gap and ensure that all Massachusetts
      children have the opportunity to succeed in school and in life. The legislation
      builds on the Commonwealth’s strong policy foundation for early education, including
      the ongoing work of the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE).
      Cost estimates range anywhere from $400 million to $1.4 billion, depending on
      the type of universal pre-K program the state seeks to implement, and whether
      it covers 3- and 4-year-olds or only 4-year-olds. The pending proposal would
      capitalize on existing grant programs and many advocates argue that it would
      actually help to reduce existing costs for special education and social services,
      pointing to successful programs in Boston, New Jersey, and Oklahoma.\n\n> Best
      Practice: Harlem Children’s Zone \nThe Harlem Children’s Zone (HCZ) is a cradle
      to college model serving thousands of youth in Harlem, NY. The organization
      offers a holistic approach, supporting their clients in educational advancement,
      family stabilization, housing security, healthy lifestyles, and social services.
      The HCZ seeks “to address the entire child and entire community of the child”[^29]
      \ including fellow residents, stakeholders, and institutions.  The HCZ boasts
      a variety of programs for youth of all ages to participate in, from formal enrollment
      in Pre-K to High School to after school and enrichment programs. A Harvard Study
      in 2009 concluded that the HCZ’s Promise Academy and additional HCZ support
      programs had closed “the black-white achievement gap in mathematics and [reduced]
      it by nearly half in English Language Arts.”[^30]\n\n### ii.\tEnsure our institutional
      learning environments are safe and welcoming to all students no matter their
      income or race\n \nOur schools prepare children and adolescents for the future
      and we all lose out when our educational environments stunt, rather than foster
      growth. We continue to see outcomes that are unequal, as youth who are Black
      and Latino do not experience similar educational outcomes as their White peers.
      Disciplinary actions in school settings serve to push students of color away
      from our educational systems. We need to continue to push for those positive
      changes that expand support for all students so that differences in outcomes
      do not persist.\n\n1. End criminalization of disruptive behavior in schools\n\nThe
      school-to-prison pipeline[^31] is a concept that describes repeated and escalating
      interactions of youth with school disciplinarians, the juvenile justice system,
      and the criminal justice system, ultimately leading to incarceration. Such interactions
      disproportionately criminalize the behavior of students of color, low-income
      students, and special education students at higher rates than their White counterparts
      for the same behaviors. Studies have shown that these students are not necessarily
      more prone to misbehavior than their peers; but policies and discrimination
      make them more likely be punished than White students.[^32] A proposed bill
      - An Act Decriminalizing Non-Violent and Verbal Student Misconduct - would help
      to dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline by limiting the use of criminal enforcement
      activities for nonviolent misconduct in schools, allowing the steps of arrest
      and prosecution only when other more appropriate school-based approaches have
      been tried and not succeeded. \n\n1. Pass “Breakfast After the Bell” legislation\n\nTwo
      out of three K-12 students that qualify for free and reduced lunch aren’t eating
      it. The stigma of the existing free breakfast programs and the logistical challenges
      of getting to school early keep students from participating in breakfast-before-the-bell
      programs. This bill requires that high poverty schools serve breakfast to all
      students at the beginning of the instructional day, or “after the bell.” Passage
      of this bill would extend existing benefits to over 260,000 students at approximately
      600 Massachusetts schools.\n\n1. Address inequitable state funding formulas
      to increase support the state’s highest-need K-12 schools\n\nIn 2015, the Department
      of Elementary and Secondary Education changed the methodology used to count
      the number of low-income students and counted only those students that already
      participate in existing state benefit programs like SNAP, TAFDC, foster care
      or MassHealth. This change led to lower state funding to schools because it
      does not accurately capture the actual number of low-income students. This new
      method misses many students who are in the school system and are economically
      disadvantaged because it fails to account for those low-income students who
      are not accessing social services, which often include homeless youth and newly
      arrived immigrants. The current approach to counting low-income students leaves
      some of our most financially challenged communities with a significant financial
      gap. Adequate funding is critical to our communities and will ensure they receive
      the funding necessary to provide all students with education they deserve. Address
      inequitable state funding formulas to increase support the state’s highest-need
      K-12 schools.\n\n### iii.\tMake college accessible to all\n\nA college degree
      continues to be associated with higher earnings and sustained labor force participation.
      We see increasingly that most job opportunities seek a minimum of a college
      degree from prospective job seekers. Unfortunately, our region continues to
      see inequalities among those who have a bachelor’s degree or higher. We can
      make greater investments in opportunities for low-income populations and Black
      and Latino populations in order to close these gaps. We must create more routes
      to a college degree, especially for those who are looking to move beyond mid-skill
      job opportunities.\n\n1. Free tuition at community colleges\n\nFree tuition
      at community colleges for residents who have graduated high school or have completed
      their GEDs, would remove a barrier to individuals seeking to advance their career.
      Educational attainment is a strong indicator of how much money an individual
      will make and has long-term economic impacts as well. According to the U.S.
      Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median usual weekly earnings for someone with
      a high school diploma is $692, but for an Associate’s degree and Bachelor’s
      degree, is $892 and $1,156 respectively.[^33] The reverse trend is seen with
      unemployment rates, with higher unemployment rates correlating with lower educational
      attainment.\n\nIn 2017, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh and Governor Charlie Baker
      rolled out the Boston Bridge, a continuation of Boston’s Tuition-Free Community
      College Plan. The Plan “pays for the costs of tuition and mandatory fees that
      are not covered by the Pell Grant”[^34] for low income city residents for up
      to three years of community college. The Boston Bridge is a pilot program that
      would allow these same students to then transfer into a four-year program through
      the state’s Commonwealth Commitment Program.\n\nCalifornia, Kentucky, Missouri,
      Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee have all passed legislation or adopted pilot
      programs to provide some form of tuition free community college, while other
      states like Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, and South Dakota have free tuition
      at community colleges for targeted fields of study.\n\n>EMERGING PRACTICE: High
      School/First Year of Community College. In several states, school districts
      are collaborating with area community colleges to offer a combination of high
      school and community college courses. The programs use local school district
      funds that would have supported the student in the district to cover the students
      cost in attending the community college, which typically equates to a reduced
      or free tuition for the college courses. The programs have been used to create
      a better transition to higher education for those who have met their high school
      educational requirements but face challenges in affording or accessing a college
      setting. Examples include the City of Eugene's (OR) Advanced Career Technical
      (A.C.T.) program and the City of Austin’s (TX) Early College High School program.\n\n1.
      In-state tuition for undocumented youth\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center,
      there are 210,000 undocumented immigrants in Massachusetts, including over 8,000
      DACA recipients.[^35] DACA, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival, was created
      in June 2012 by President Obama and enabled undocumented individuals brought
      to the U.S. as children to receive Social Security numbers, temporary work permits,
      and protection from deportation, as long as they met age requirements, demonstrated
      physical presence, met educational or military service requirements, and passed
      a criminal background check. In 2012, Governor Patrick took Executive Action
      that allowed DACA recipients to be eligible for in-state tuition at the 29 public
      colleges and universities, as long as they met the Board of Higher Education’s
      residency requirements. While this is still the current policy in Massachusetts,
      recent federal actions require that the Commonwealth pass legislation to extend
      in-state tuition at public higher education institutions to current DACA recipients
      and allow other undocumented immigrants who are not DACA eligible to enroll
      in college as in-state students. Full implementation of in-state tuition for
      undocumented immigrants could result in an additional $7 million of annual revenue
      to the public university system.[^36]\n\n> Emerging Practice: Wraparound service
      for first in family college attendees\nFirst generation college students, particularly
      first generation college students from communities of color, face emotional,
      lifestyle, and financial barriers on their path to graduation. As a result many
      aspiring college students either turn down acceptances or matriculate and quickly
      drop out. Wraparound support services for students from underrepresented populations
      seek to address these poor outcomes. A student in wraparound services receives
      case management services, housing assistance, academic and career support, and
      solutions to basic needs. \n\nOne example is Florida State University’s US Program
      that serves youth experiencing foster care, homelessness, and relative care.
      The US Program enrolled its first cohort in 2012 and as of 2016 participants
      had a 91% retention rate and a 3.01 grade point average. \n\n[^28]:MassBudget,

  - title: 'We eliminate harmful conditions and environments beginning with the people
      and places that have the greatest health needs. '
    anchor: report-environment
    text: "It is much easier for a person to stand up and move forward when that person
      does not have to carry a heavy burden, whether it be financial, physical, psychological,
      or a combination of each. Unfortunately, our region is home to many communities
      whose environments stand as barriers to their desire for healthier, more resilient,
      and economically stable lives. Under-investment in communities of color has
      created structural barriers to success and new programs, like those around clean
      energy investments, have frequently passed over these places due to lack of
      understanding and capacity. In particular, communities of color are subject
      to environmental disparities, living in neighborhoods located close to densely
      congested highways or home to hazardous power plants, which has forced the communities
      to deal with these existing issues instead of on new opportunities and innovations.
      We believe that for all people to thrive, regardless of background, policies
      must eliminate these intrinsic barriers and be more cognizant of how we ensure
      all resident of the region can be prepared to meet the environmental challenges
      to come.\n\n### i.\tEnhance community resilience and sustainability to meet
      the present and future challenges\n\nWe must make investments that strengthen
      communities by better preparing individuals and families to deal with natural
      hazards like floods and heat waves as well as meet the new challenges we expect
      from these natural events. We can build a more resilient region by making structural
      investments that foster community resiliency as well as positioning our residents
      to benefit from new technologies that are intended to increase economic and
      energy security.\n\n1. Expand the Mass Solar Loan Program to more effectively
      reach low-income households that are credit invisible or have unscored credit
      records.\n\nExpand the Mass Solar Loan Program to more effectively reach low-income
      households that are credit invisible or have unscored credit records.\n> \nBest
      Practice: Climate Justice Initiatives\nClimate Justice recognizes that the negative
      effects of climate change fall most harshly on those who contributed the least
      to its causes, low income communities and communities of color. As the climate
      changes these populations will be the first to face negative health outcomes,
      financial hardships and social and cultural disruptions. Climate Justice Proponents
      seek to spread these burdens of climate change as well as the benefits addressing
      climate change will create. \n\nIn 2012 California created a model for climate
      justice legislation passing a bill that allocates resources to the communities
      most hurt by climate change. Twenty-five percent of proceeds from California’s
      Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund will pay for projects in disadvantaged communities,
      which they identify through the CalEnviroScreen, a screening methodology used
      to identify communities that are burdened by multiple sources of pollution.
      \   \n\n1. Protect at-risk populations from current and future environmental
      hazards.\n\nThe legislature is currently considering a proposal that would require
      that all residents who live in the Commonwealth have equal environmental justice,
      and all executive Secretariats develop policies and strategies to achieve environmental
      justice. This would include the appointment of a Director of Environmental Justice
      at the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs.  The proposal also
      creates a supplemental fund to support environmentally beneficial projects in
      low-income communities. The proposal is particularly important because we often
      see low-income communities living in climate-vulnerable locations. As superstorms
      and chemicals impact our municipalities, we have to make sure that all residents
      live somewhere they can expect to remain safe from climate hazards. \n\n1. Provide
      a comprehensive energy efficiency program offering to effectively meet the needs
      of moderate-income customers and renters across the Commonwealth.\n\nThe low-income
      energy efficiency program in Massachusetts is a leader in the clean energy field,
      but it is limited to serving households at or below 60% of Area Median Income.
      The energy efficiency Program Administrators were instructed to roll out a moderate-income
      offer, but the impacts of this will be difficult to measure. We must continue
      to engage in robust advocacy to ensure that the needs of historically underserved
      populations are met by the state’s energy efficiency programs at the same time
      as we identify and approval additional program funding mechanisms, especially
      for moderate income customers. \n\n> Emerging Practice: Just Transition\nJust
      Transition is the practice of supporting vulnerable populations in the face
      of massive economic shifts both due to and to avoid climate change and loss
      of biodiversity. It is in response to the history of chaotic, harmful economic
      restructurings that have overwhelmingly affected low income communities of color.
      Just Transition ensures that the cost of these beneficial changes is not borne
      by a select few.\n\nJust Transition solutions are as diverse as the problem
      it hopes to solve. The Black Mesa Water Coalition in Arizona and their Just
      Transition Campaign is a leading example of community activism and involvement.
      The group has succeeded in shutting down polluting facilities and replacing
      them with clean community controlled sourced of energy and green economy jobs.
      In Boulder, Colorado the Just Transition Collaborative notes that non-homeowners
      lack the opportunity to invest in solar and may bear the brunt of shifts in
      utilities. The City of Boulder, per a recommendation of the Just Transition
      Collaborative, is designing a program to provide energy subsidies for the elderly,
      and low-income individuals, particularly low-income individuals of color. \n\n1.
      Establish and fund a pilot program for shared electric vehicle services in Environmental
      Justice communities.\n\nLow-income families of color are less likely to own
      a vehicle than white and high-income families. Additionally, households in the
      lower third of the income range dedicate more of their household income to transportation
      costs than the upper third of the national income range. Providing shared mobility
      services with electric vehicles that have zero tail pipe emissions within environmental
      justice communities can potentially improve access to opportunity and improve
      local air quality through reduced emissions. The state will need to allocate
      significant new resources to support a successful program. Along with other
      New England states, Massachusetts is currently considering a regional cap and
      trade program for transportation-related emissions. If this passes, it could
      be a significant new source of funding available to reinvest in programs and
      initiatives designed to reduce emissions from the transportation sector.\n\n###
      ii.\tEliminate food insecurity among families\nFamilies in our region are healthier
      when they do not have to worry if they will have access to nutritious foods.
      Unfortunately, many children and adults in the Metro Boston region do not have
      access to enough nutritious food to support an active and healthy life, and
      as a result we see many resulting health issues. We can reduce these health
      issues by focusing on eliminating food insecurity. Most importantly, we can
      see the greatest impact on equality of outcomes by focusing on those who experience
      insecurity and health related issues the most.\n\n1. Reduce the “SNAP gap”\n\nThe
      legislature is currently considering a proposal that would establish a common
      application for individuals who receive state benefits. It would allow those
      individuals who are eligible to simultaneously apply for the supplemental nutrition
      assistance program (SNAP) and other income support and benefit programs when
      the individual applies for or renews MassHealth coverage or other state application
      or renewal process. The legislation address the fact that an estimated 680,000
      people who are receiving MassHealth are likely also eligible for SNAP but are
      not currently enrolled. \n\n1. Fund and expand the Healthy Incentives Program\n\nThe
      statewide Healthy Incentives Program (HIP) was launched in April 2017, which
      will apply a one-dollar incentive on every SNAP benefit dollar spent on vegetables
      and fruits when purchased at four types of SNAP retailers selling locally-grown
      produce: farmers markets, farm stands, community supported agriculture programs,
      and mobile markets. It is modeled after a regional Massachusetts pilot which
      found that participants consumed over 25 percent more fruits and vegetables
      than did non-participants. The proposed bill would permanently establish an
      incentives program that would ensure sustainability of the current 3-year HIP
      and expand the types of SNAP retailers eligible to participate in the program.
      \n\n1. Support the Massachusetts Food Trust initiative\n\nThe Massachusetts
      Food Trust Program, established in 2014, would provide loans, grants and technical
      assistance to support new and expanded healthy food retailers and local food
      enterprises in low- and moderate-income communities. This could include supermarkets,
      corner stores, farmer’s markets, mobile markets, community kitchens, food co-ops,
      food truck commissaries, indoor and outdoor greenhouses, and food distribution
      hubs. This private partnership program was a recommendation of the Grocery Access
      Task Force, a public-private partnership which met for about two years to tackle
      this problem. \n\n### iii.\tUse economic incentives to reduce population health
      risks\n\nOur communities are stronger when families have fair access to services
      and products that are supportive and healthful. Unfortunately, what should be
      simple is frequently made difficult for certain populations, including people
      of color and families trapped in poverty. For example, food marketers target
      unhealthy foods to communities of color and to children,  and when these foods
      contribute to health issues like diabetes and hypertension, little community-based
      support is provided to help manage these conditions. As a result, we see health
      issues persist and those who already experience systemic challenges in their
      daily life have to shoulder additional burdens. We can change this by shifting
      where dollars come from and how we invest in the services that create pathways
      for people, especially those most at risk, to enjoy healthier lives.\n\n1. Tax
      soda and other sugary beverages\n\nThe legislature is currently considering
      a proposal that would create a tiered excise tax on sugary drinks with rates
      based on the amount of added sugar each beverage contains. As the amount of
      sugar increases, the amount of tax would also increase. Sugary drink taxes have
      been successfully implemented across the country, generating significant new
      revenue that can be reinvested in a wide range of programs and creating a reduction
      in the overall consumption of sugary beverages. Researchers have estimated that
      an excise tax of a penny per ounce of sugar on sugar-sweetened beverages would
      prevent 45,900 cases of obesity by 2025, saving the Commonwealth $33.40 for
      every dollar invested in implementation of the bill. Revenue from a tiered excise
      tax could raise approximately $368 million in the first year, and would decrease
      annually as consumption decreases. The revenue would be reinvested into public
      health initiatives, including access to clean and safe drinking water, the Prevention
      and Wellness Trust Fund, and other programs focused on children. \n\n1. Fund
      the Prevention and Wellness Trust Fund\n\nThe Prevention and Wellness Trust
      Fund has increased access to preventative services for nearly one million people
      across the Commonwealth. The Fund does not rely on state funding, but is supported
      by a small assessment on health insurers. The program has been nationally recognized
      as a model because it has increased access to preventative services for nearly
      1 million people across Massachusetts, including 22,000 students with asthma.
      Funding for the program ended in 2017. \n\n> BEST PRACTICE: Access to Contraception\nIn
      November 2017, Governor Baker signed a law making contraception free to all
      Massachusetts women. The bill required Massachusetts health insurance companies
      to provide coverage for most contraceptive drugs, devices and products without
      requiring a copay. Research has long shown that contraception has significant
      health benefits for women because it can reduce the risk for ovarian and endometrial
      cancers, and it can treat conditions like endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome
      or uterine fibroids. On top of that, women with unintended pregnancies are more
      likely to receive delayed or no prenatal care. This legislation will make it
      easier for women to get the health care that they need and to take family planning
      decisions back into their own hands. \n\n### iv.\tInvest in programs that prevent
      harm and foster recovery\n\nViolence and addiction not only affect those directly
      involved, their effects ripple outward among family members and surrounding
      neighborhoods. In 2017, over 1,000 Massachusetts residents died from opioid
      overdose.  In Boston, 16 teenagers were killed by guns, a figure that represents
      a doubling from the previous year. The causes of violent behavior and addition
      are complex. But, if we are going to offer any hope of turning the tide of these
      avoidable deaths, we must focus our efforts on prevention and recovery rather
      than condemnation and punishment.\n\n1. Increase funding for the Shannon Grant
      and the Safe and Successful Youth Initiative\n\nSince 2006, the Commonwealth
      has used the Senator Charles E. Shannon Grant to curb youth violence, gang violence
      and substance abuse through regional, multi-disciplinary efforts. Communication
      across municipal lines and coordination between public safety officers and social
      service agencies is what sets Shannon Grants apart from other efforts to fund
      local law enforcement prevention programs. The Safe and Successful Youth Initiative,
      implemented in 2011 after youth violence in Massachusetts was at an all-time
      high, combines public health and public safety approached to eliminating serious
      violence among high-risk urban youth. The program provides funding to support
      an intervention strategy that provides education, training and workforce development
      programs, as well as street outreach and trauma counseling. Funding programs
      that allow young people to create strong community relationships has a strong
      public health benefit for the youth in the program and for the communities where
      they live, providing a safe place for young people to go every day, with safe
      adults and mentors they can trust. \n\n1. Create better access to long-term
      treatment for people suffering from Substance Use Disorders\n\nMunicipal service
      providers want to better connect individuals with Substance Use Disorders to
      immediate treatment options and offer a continuum of wrap-around services to
      support long-term recovery. Mechanisms to address this include the expansion
      of existing, successful programs to enhance recovery services and the development
      of new tools to support these vital connections. In order to create better access
      to long-term treatment, policy makers must identify successful programs that
      provide for both immediate treatment and long-term services, such as housing,
      food, transportation, or employment; profile successful programs and include
      lessons learned, ways to implement these in other communities, and opportunities
      for expanding these services on a regional or multi-community level; and initiate
      program partnership discussions and develop partnership proposals based on the
      program profile identified. Connecting people to appropriate recovery services
      as soon as possible after an incident/overdoes, such as medically-aided treatment
      and recovery coach monitoring programs, is considered vital to saving lives. \n\n\n\n\n"
  - title: We have a public safety and justice system that protects residents of all
      backgrounds.
    anchor: public-safety-report
    text: "As of January 1, 2016, there were over 10,000 people in prison in Massachusetts
      Department of Correction facilities. Among the incarcerated, Black and Latino
      inmates are severely overrepresented. While the state population is 7% Black
      and 11% Latino, the state’s inmates are 27% Black and 25% Latino. We must work
      to reduce the incarceration rate overall, close the racial incarceration gap,
      and address the racial inequities in our justice system. We must also do more
      to support released prisoners as they reenter society.\n\n### i.\tEnd disparate
      incarceration rates among populations of color\n\nPeople of color are disproportionately
      overrepresented in the Massachusetts criminal justice system and throughout
      the country. There can be no denying that “implicit and explicit racial bias
      in policing and arrests lead to more convictions and tougher sentencing of people
      of color.” Recent killings of unarmed black men by police and increased visibility
      of these incidents through social media and activism have raised the profile
      of the issue, and these experiences lead to mistrust of law enforcement personnel.
      Legislators and policy experts must address implicit bias, and must also find
      solutions to regain community trust. \n\n1. Require police departments to conduct
      implicit bias trainings\n\nIn the context of criminal justice, implicit bias
      has a profound effect on the relationship between law enforcement officers and
      residents. Six cities around the country are currently participating in the
      National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice, and a bill is
      currently pending in the State House that would require implicit bias training
      for law enforcement officers in Massachusetts. If we can acknowledge and reduce
      implicit bias, then we can reduce the incidence of unlawful arrests and convictions
      in communities of color, and help to strengthen relationships between police
      and community members, which can have a profound effect on our communities and
      residents of color in the Commonwealth.\n\n1. Pass legislation to require that
      a special prosecutor conduct investigations into death from a police shooting.\n\nThe
      current system to investigate police misconduct has raised questions of impartiality
      across the country. Police departments and prosecutors of the same jurisdiction
      typically work together and rely on one another throughout their careers. When
      prosecutors use special grand juries in a matter of police misconduct, there
      is a legitimate question about whether a conflict of interest exists. If the
      Attorney General were to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate police
      misconduct, it would address this potential conflict of interest and serve as
      a means to improve transparency and accountability. \n\n> \nEmerging PRACTICE:
      Require law enforcement officers to wear body cameras while they are on duty.\nSome
      studies have shown that when police officers wear body cameras, it can improve
      the police-resident encounter. Other research suggests that body cameras do
      not improve the relationship or the trust between the police and residents.
      Boston recently implemented a 100-camera study, and the results of this study
      should inform whether body cameras become required for all law enforcement officers
      while they are on duty. \n\n### ii.\tTransition to a restorative justice framework
      that focuses on rehabilitation and re-integration\n\nResearch shows that increasing
      incarceration rates has minimal impact on reducing crime, and that between 2010
      and 2015, crime dropped faster in states that had declining rates of incarceration.
      Massachusetts still uses several outmoded forms of extreme punishment that are
      not shown to meaningfully reduce recidivism rates. As we look to update our
      criminal justice system, we should adopt a framework of restorative justice
      (i.e., one that repair of harm and rehabilitation) and of addressing the socio-cultural
      roots of crime that can impact our communities. \n\n1. Limit solitary confinement
      in all Massachusetts correctional facilities\n\nHuman rights organizations,
      legal scholars, health professionals and advocates all agree that solitary confinement
      is a violation of basic human rights and should be abolished or severely restricted.
      Most proponents agree that inmates should only be kept in solitary confinement
      if they pose a threat to the prison population and they should be given special
      behavioral programming to address the underlying issues. Any inmate in solitary
      confinement must experience humane treatment and be given access to regular
      programs and services.\nRaise juvenile jurisdiction from 18 to 21 and expunge
      juvenile records.\nCurrently 18-year-olds are automatically tried as adults
      in Massachusetts, but many advocates argue that this should be raised to 21
      for some offenses. There is significant evidence to suggest that the adult brain
      isn’t fully formed until a person is closer to 20 years old, and that the differences
      in brain development lead to challenges with impulse control. Young people who
      remain in the juvenile justice system are far more likely to finish school and
      receive workforce training or coaching than those who land in adult justice
      systems. \nWhen 18-year-olds are tried as adults and sent to adult prisons,
      they are at greater risk of recidivism and developing mental health issues.
      Juvenile records are typically sealed, but if a young person commits a crime
      and is tried as an adult, the record will follow them for the rest of their
      life. \n\n1. Eliminate “fine time” and better evaluate low-income defendants’
      ability to pay\n\nSince 2010, 48 states have increased civil and/or criminal
      fees that are assessed on defendants. Debt accumulated through court-imposed
      fines and fees can show up on an individual’s credit score and consequently
      affect their ability to secure housing or employment. In Massachusetts, criminal
      defendants who cannot afford to pay court-imposed fines can be ordered to serve
      jail time, adding $30 per day onto their debt until it is resolved. This practice
      disproportionately affects low-income people of color. Other proposals would
      allow the court officer to determine a defendants’ ability to pay before assessing
      fines and fees, and would create a more flexible fine system. \n\n1. Repeal
      mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses\n\nMandatory minimum
      sentences can lead to over-incarceration that are disproportionate to the crimes
      committed. People sentenced to mandatory minimum often aren’t eligible for early
      release programs or other transition programs. Instead, particularly for nonviolent
      drug offenses, judges should have the ability to make sentencing decisions on
      a case-by-case basis. \n\n1. Allow for community-based sentencing alternatives
      for people convicted of nonviolent crimes\n\nData suggests that incarceration,
      especially over longer periods of time, is correlated with recidivism. While
      prisons may serve to protect our communities from those who have a high risk
      to offend, these same prisons can end up holding many who have committed non-violent
      crimes. Placing these non-violent offenders in prison may contribute to the
      risk of physical and mental health issues, does add to the economic burden of
      our prison system, and, most importantly, removes these individuals, especially
      women and caretakers, from families and neighborhoods that rely on them. Many
      states, including California and New York, have taken steps to eliminate mandatory
      sentencing for non-violent offenders and create programmatic alternatives to
      hold the offenders accountable for their behavior while reducing the potential
      for lasting negative outcomes from involvement in the prison system. An example
      of this legislation in MA is the Primary Caretakers bill which would keep parents
      and children together as the either parent fulfills their obligations under
      a community-based sentencing alternative.\n\n> BEST PRACTICE: Programs that
      focus on re-entry\nCheshire T.R.U.E. Prison Program, Connecticut: In March 2017,
      Governor Malloy announced that Connecticut Department of Corrections would build
      a new facility to house inmates ages 18-25. The Governor partnered with the
      Vera Institute of Justice on this project. This age group has the highest rates
      of recidivism and the T.R.U.E. (Truthfulness, Respectfulness, Understanding,
      and Elevating) program aims to target this group of inmates differently from
      the adult population and provide special programming and services. \n\nIn Massachusetts,
      Middlesex County Sheriff Peter Koutoujian announced a new program that will
      house offenders age 18-24 in a separate facility beginning in February 2018.
      This is an initiative in collaboration with the Vera Institute of Justice and
      UTEC. This program is modeled on Connecticut’s T.R.U.E. program. According to
      the Sheriff’s office, “Nationwide, 18- to 24-year-olds comprise 10 percent of
      the population, but account for 21 percent of all individuals admitted to adult
      prisons each year.”\n\n\n"
