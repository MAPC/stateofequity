    suggest that conditions which contribute to inequity are persisting or becoming
    more severe: discrimination, whether overt or systemic, continues to limit opportunity
    for some residents; income and wealth disparity is increasing, dimming the prospects
    for upward mobility; and residential segregation, especially segregation by income,
    is becoming more severe. "

    anchor: introduction
    text: "The Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) is the regional planning
      agency serving the people who live and work in the 101 cities and towns of Metropolitan
      Boston. Our mission is to promote smart growth and regional collaboration. Our
      regional plan, MetroFuture, guides our work as we engage the public in responsible
      stewardship of our region’s future. We work toward sound municipal management,
      sustainable land use, protection of natural resources, efficient and affordable
      transportation, a diverse housing stock, public safety, economic development,
      clean energy, healthy communities, an informed public, and equity and opportunity
      among people of all backgrounds.\n\nMAPC believes that achieving equity is paramount
      to the long-term economic and social well-being and sustainable future of the
      Metro Boston region, as well as the entire Commonwealth. \nWe believe that equity
      means that all people have full and equal access to opportunities that enable
      them to attain their full potential.\n\nIn an equitable region, everyone has
      equal access to opportunities and each resident has a chance to grow up healthy,
      receive a quality education, get a well-paying job that ensures quality of life,
      and enjoy life into later years. An equitable Metro Boston is free from discrimination
      that marginalizes people based on race, sex, religion, disability, national
      origin, immigration status, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or marital
      status, income, military status, criminal history, or age. It holds up leaders
      from marginalized groups and centers the experiences of the disenfranchised. MAPC
      seeks to advance equity in the region through our organizational policies and
      project selection. \n\n## MAPC Equity\nIn 2011, MAPC released “The State of
      Equity in Metro Boston,” a report providing compelling detail on inequality
      across many sectors, including housing, transportation, public health, and contaminated
      environments. In 2014, MAPC wrote “The State of Equity in Metro Boston: Policy
      Agenda” which attempted to provide recommendations of policies and implementation
      steps needed to address the disparities highlighted in the 2011 report. In February
      2017, MAPC released a five-year update to the State of Equity indicators report,
      tracking the indicators over time. \n\nOf the many findings, the State of Equity
      indicators report update found that 1) even though the region is becoming more
      diverse, it is becoming more economically segregated; 2) children’s health is
      improving, but there continue to be disparities—in some cases worsening—among
      different racial and ethnic groups that limit their long-term health, educational,
      and economic outcomes; 3) educational attainment disparities remain, even though
      the standardized test scores of students of all racial and ethnic backgrounds,
      and low-income students have improved; the scores of students with disabilities
      and English language learning students have not meaningfully improved, and these
      students have the lowest test scores of all groups 4) income and economic inequality
      has become worse; 5) Black and Latino residents, residents with disabilities,
      and residents without a college degree still face barriers to full employment;
      6) residents of all backgrounds are living longer, but face financial challenges
      in their later years.\n\nThis “State of Equity Policy Agenda Update” is not
      just an update to the 2014 Policy Agenda, but a document meant to provide specific
      policy recommendations to address the myriad of disparities discussed in the
      2017 State of Equity indicators report and beyond. The recommendations found
      in this document, seek to advance local and regional policy changes that mitigate
      and eliminate inequalities and inequities. Additionally, the Policy Agenda Update
      is not meant to be confined to the work of MAPC, but rather to serve as a tool
      for our partners, coalitions, legislators, municipal officials, policy experts,
      and other interested parties, for them to think about the ways they can pursue
      real and meaningful change for their respective communities. \n\n## Process
      to Update the Equity Policy Agenda \nMAPC worked to ensure that the Policy Agenda
      and the input that went into this work, was done thoughtfully and intentionally.
      Our staff reviewed the 2014 Policy Agenda and assessed the progress made on
      those initial policy recommendations. MAPC organized an Advisory Committee to
      assist in framing and discussing what policy suggestions or topic areas must
      be included in this policy agenda update. It was important to MAPC and to this
      document, to invite voices from all different fields, backgrounds and experiences
      to our Advisory Committee. We held two meetings with the Advisory Committee.
      The first meeting was to provide an overview of the work MAPC had done on equity
      issues and to hear from those members on what equity issues most needed to be
      addressed. From this meeting, our staff compiled that list of issues and categorized
      them into the X # of topic issues of: . The second meeting was…..\n\nAfter our
      team completed the draft of policy recommendations, we had to pass it through
      our internal approval process which includes bringing it to our Legislative
      Committee, and then Executive Committee.\n\n## The Policy Agenda and Essential
      Changes for a More Equitable Metro Boston Region\n\nThe current political climate
      at the federal level has become more partisan and grid locked over the past
      few months. This however, reinforces the importance of being politically involved
      at the municipal and state level. Policymakers now have a unique opportunity
      to take back some of the responsibility that at times was defaulted to federal
      entities."

  text: "## Brief Overview of Agenda\nThe 2014 Equity Policy Agenda was released to
    serve as an update to the MetroFuture Implementation Strategies and was based
    on the findings of the 2011 State of Equity in Metro Boston Indicators Report.
    The report made recommendations in three main categories:\n\n1)\tInvest in places\n2)\tInvest
    in people\n3)\tBuild more equitable public systems\n\nThe recommendations outlined
    in the report included planning, policy and funding changes at every level of
    government and steps that could be taken by the private sector and individual
    households. \n\nMany of the recommendations in the 2014 policy agenda highlighted
    a best practice area that a city or town could undertake and that required no
    legislative or policy change. While the best practices included are often the
    low-hanging fruit that can be easily accomplished, the previous policy agenda
    did not include policy strategies or specific policy actions for some of the biggest
    inequities facing our region, such as...\n\n## Progress and Next Steps\nIn the
    past few years, Massachusetts has made some strides towards addressing inequities.
    We have passed legislation that protects transgender individuals, provides wage
    fairness and pay equity for women, and we have modestly increased the minimum
    wage. We have increased the Earned Income Tax Credit in order to provide a refund
    to low-income families, and we have provided funding for programs that aim to
    curb youth violence. These are all important steps that we have taken to address
    pressing needs in the Commonwealth. \n\nBut there is more work to do because we
    have not moved the needle enough. Too many children in Massachusetts wake up hungry
    every day. Home affordability remains impossibly high for most families. Low-income
    families often have to choose between medicine and transportation. And some of
    our most marginalized residents often have very few options or paths to achieve
    success.\n\n"

  - title: Equity Indicators Overview
    anchor: indicators-overview
    text: "## Equity Indicators Overview\nIn 2011 MAPC released The State of Equity
      in Metro Boston, an inventory of cross- sectoral indicators that measured inequity
      in the region. Those indicators informed the creation of MAPC’s State of Equity
      Policy Agenda in 2014. MAPC’s 2017 update to the State of Equity indicators
      report was published in February, 2017 and forms the basis for the agenda put
      forth in this document. The following section summarizes major findings of the
      2017 State of Equity indicators report. \n\nThe indicators suggest that conditions
      which contribute to inequity are persisting or becoming more severe: discrimination,
      whether overt or systemic, continues to limit opportunity for residents of color
      and residents with disabilities; income and wealth disparity is increasing,
      dimming the prospects for upward mobility; and residential segregation, especially
      segregation by income, is becoming more severe. \nDiversity and Segregation\nMetro
      Boston is becoming more diverse every decade. In 1970, the region’s population
      was 5% people of color—Asian, Black, Latino, Native American, multiracial and
      other non-White residents; by 2010, that figure had grown to 28%. MAPC projects
      that by 2040 the region will be at least 40% people of color. The region has
      also grown in share of foreign-born residents, and as of 2011-2015, 20% of Metro
      Boston residents were born outside of the U.S. Even as it grows more diverse,
      the region remains racially and economically segregated. \n\nThe Dissimilarity
      Index, which measures the extent to which two groups are similarly distributed
      across the region, has shown decreasing Black – White segregation since 1980.
      However, the Dissimilarity Index for Latinos and Whites is now higher than it
      was in 1990, indicating a greater degree of segregation between the two groups.
      Other measures of economic segregation demonstrate that the region’s poorest
      households are becoming increasingly concentrated into low-income neighborhoods
      with little income diversity.\n\n## Housing\nPeople of color live in less-affluent
      neighborhoods than white households with comparable earnings. Odds are that
      a White household earning $78,000 per year lives in a neighborhood where the
      median household income of its neighbors is $72,000. Meanwhile, a Black household
      earning exactly the same is likely to live in a neighborhood where the median
      income is just $51,000. This disparity has increased substantially since 2000.
      \n\n## Health\nIn 2011, we found that racial disparities in low birth weight
      eclipsed the differences attributable to education level, most notably for Black
      women. Based on 2005-2009 data, a college-educated Black woman was 40% more
      likely to have a low birth weight baby than a White woman without a high school
      diploma (8.5% among Black women with a college degree, 6.2% among White women
      with less than a high school degree). In 2017, with more recent data, we found
      that instances of low birth weight among Black women have declined slightly
      (from 10.4% in 2005-2009 to 9.4% in 2010-2014 among Black women without a high
      school degree, and from 8.5% to 7.2% among Black women with a college degree),
      but the significant preexisting disparity means that those gains have not substantially
      bridged the gap between White women and Black women. \n\n## Racial health disparities
      continue into childhood. In fact, in the case of childhood asthma, disparities
      have become more severe over time. Data from 2008-2012 show a 10% increase in
      overall youth asthma hospitalizations, compared to data from 2003-2007. This
      increase was driven by statistically significant increases in Black and Latino
      youth rates. Black youth in the more recent data experienced a rate of asthma
      hospitalization 2.7 times higher than the regional average, and climbing. While
      the rates for Latino youth were closer to the regional average, they increased
      22% over the five year interval. \n\n## Education\nStandardized test performance
      improved across almost all demographic categories between 2009 and 2015, and
      the gains were largest for Black and Latino students. For the 10th Grade Math
      MCAS, the percent of Black and Latino students scoring Advanced or Proficient
      grew by 9 percentage points and 7 percentage points, respectively. The gap in
      scores between these groups and White students dropped by 5 points and 3 points,
      though the gaps remain large, at 26 points. These groups also saw even larger
      increases in their four-year graduation rates, and the gap in graduation rate
      with Whites fell by one quarter. Suspension rates in schools with more than
      50% students of color are half of what they were in 2006 – 2007, though they
      still remain twice as high as the average for all schools in the region. \n\n##
      Income\nThe most recent earnings data show that income polarization is increasing,
      and that this polarization disproportionately affects Black and Latino residents.
      The average income for the highest-earning fifth of households ($280,600) is
      18 times higher than average income for the lowest-income fifth of households
      ($15,800). That disparity has increased by two points since 2006. The highest-income
      fifth earns 15% more than it did in 2006, while the lowest-income fifth earns
      just 3% more. This can be attributed in part to wage polarization and the decline
      of the middle class. This polarization disproportionately affects Black and
      Latino households, whose median household incomes are less than half those of
      White and Asian households.\n\n## Homeownership\nHomeownership is one of the
      cornerstones of building wealth in America. MAPC’s 2011 report found that people
      of color—even those who earn a substantial income—face continued discrimination
      in choosing where to live. In particular, high-income applicants (those earning
      more than $118,000 per year) who are Black are more than twice as likely to
      be denied a mortgage as high-income borrowers who are White. For Black applicants,
      the denial rate dropped 4.7 percentage points, and for high-income Latino applicants
      the denial rate dropped 3.3 percentage points. While homeownership rates overall
      have dropped slightly in the last ten years, the declines have been most substantial
      for Black and Latino householders, whose homeownership rates (32% and 25%, respectively)
      are less than half of homeownership rates for White householders (68%).\n\n##
      Employment\nMetro Boston’s economy has been growing robustly since the Great
      Recession, and by the end of 2016 the Metro Boston’s official unemployment rate
      was 2.5%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). However, not everyone
      is benefiting equally from this growth. Labor force participation rate (the
      share of the working-age population working or looking for a job) for people
      with only a high school degree is 12 percentage points lower than the rate for
      those with a bachelor’s degree, and trending downward. The unemployment rate
      for workers who are Black is nearly 7 percentage points higher than the rate
      for workers who are White, and the Latino rate is nearly 5 points higher. The
      unemployment rate for people with a disability is more than ten percentage points
      higher than for people without a disability. \n\n## Criminal Justice\nInequities
      in incarceration follow clear socioeconomic and geographic trends that carry
      significant implications for individuals, families, communities, and the region.
      For individuals, encounters with the criminal justice system can have long-term
      impacts on earning power and employability, as well as mental and physical health.
      The number of inmates in Massachusetts Department of Corrections (DOC) facilities
      statewide dropped by 12% from 2010 to 2016, and the disparities in incarceration
      rate for residents who are Black and Latino also declined, albeit slowly. Black
      and Latino inmates are severely over-represented in (DOC) facilities. Although
      the state population is 7% Black and 11% Latino, the state’s DOC inmates are
      27% Black and 25% Latino. Native Americans residents, as of 2016, have the highest
      rate of incarceration in the state’s prison system.\n\n## Seniors\nAs the Baby
      Boomer generation ages, the region will experience substantial growth in the
      senior population, which may grow by 75% between 2010 and 2030. Above-average
      premature mortality rates for White and Black residents declined between 2003-2007
      and 2008-2012, while rates for Asian, Latino, and Native American residents
      remained statistically unchanged. Black residents continue to have the highest
      premature mortality rate (348 per 100,000.) \n\nGrandparents responsible for
      their grandchildren have a poverty rate of more than 15%, double that of grandparents
      not responsible for their grandchildren. Older adults are more housing cost
      burdened (meaning that they pay more than 30% of their income on housing) than
      younger adults. Nearly 60% of renter households headed by an older adult are
      cost burdened, and more than a third of households where the homeowner is an
      older adult are cost burdened. Despite a 5% drop in the total number of housing
      cost burdened young home owners, the renter and owner housing cost burden rates
      for the elderly remained unchanged between 2005-2009 and 2011-2015."
