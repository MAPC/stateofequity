  text: "### Unlocking the potential in all residents\n\nThe Metropolitan Area Planning
    Council (MAPC) released our regional plan, MetroFuture, in 2008, and it envisions
    a sustainable, prosperous and equitable future for the region. Indeed, our region
    enjoys many successes and many residents have seen an improvement in their health,
    education and income. But prosperity in our region and the benefits that accompany
    it have not been enjoyed by all residents of the region.\nBy leaving residents
    behind or overlooking unmet needs, we are holding back the true potential of the
    Metro Boston region and we are failing in our promise to improve the lives of
    everyone who lives and works here. That’s why an equity agenda for policy change
    is needed.\n\n### A Pathway for Greater Prosperity and Dignity\n\nThe 2018 State
    of Equity Policy Agenda provides policy recommendations to address the opportunities
    and disparities identified in the 2017 State of Equity indicators. The agenda
    is not meant to be confined to the work of MAPC, but rather to serve as a tool
    for coalition partners, legislators, municipal officials, policy experts, and
    other interested parties, to think about the ways they can pursue real and meaningful
    change for our communities. \n\n### Equity & MAPC\nMAPC has embraced equity in
    MetroFuture and as a strategic priority. The agency looks to use its unique position
    to help address how the social, natural, and built environment contribute to inequality
    in our region. We believe be doing so that region can join other regions across
    the country that are more equitable and integrated and that have demonstrated
    sustained economic growth. \n\n\n### Policy Change Goals \nThe State of Equity
    Policy Agenda includes the following six goals that, if achieved, will lead to
    greater equity across our region: \n\n1.\tInclusive, diverse communities where
    everyone can afford to live and thrive.\n2.\tConvenient and affordable options
    to access good jobs, schools and recreation.\n3.\tGood jobs and pathways to prosperity.\n4.\tA
    solid foundation in education by offering affordable and quality education, from
    pre-school to college.\n5.\tElimination of conditions and harmful environments
    that leave people sick or injured.\n6.\tA public safety and justice system that
    protects residents of all backgrounds.\n\n### WHERE WE GO FROM HERE\nThe policy
    agenda is a contribution to ongoing progress that many of our allies and partners
    are already leading. We hope that as an active participant in this shared work,
    especially with those who work tirelessly to address systemic and social barriers,
    we can unlock the potential in all residents of the Metro Boston region.\n"

  text: "### Dedication\nWe dedicate the policy agenda to the numerous community and
    organization leaders whose tireless work has shown that all in the Boston region
    have the potential to succeed but that systemic and social barriers prevent such
    success. We make the contribution knowing it represents an ongoing process, one
    in which we look to be an active participant and an ally. We hope through shared
    work we can unlock the potential in all residents of the Metro Boston region.\n\n###

  anchor: introduction
  text: "The Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) is the regional planning agency
    serving the people who live and work in the 101 cities and towns of Metropolitan
    Boston. Our mission is to promote smart growth and regional collaboration. Our
    regional plan, MetroFuture, guides our work as we engage the public in responsible
    stewardship of our region’s future. We work toward sound municipal management,
    sustainable land use, protection of natural resources, efficient and affordable
    transportation, a diverse housing stock, public safety, economic development,
    clean energy, healthy communities, an informed public, and equity and opportunity
    among people of all backgrounds.\n\nMAPC believes that achieving equity is paramount
    to the long-term economic and social well-being and sustainable future of the
    Metro Boston region, as well as the entire Commonwealth. \nWe believe that equity
    means that all people have full and equal access to opportunities that enable
    them to attain their full potential.\n\nIn an equitable region, everyone has equal
    access to opportunities and each resident has a chance to grow up healthy, receive
    a quality education, get a well-paying job that ensures quality of life, and enjoy
    life[^foot] into later years. An equitable Metro Boston is free from discrimination
    that marginalizes people based on race, sex, religion, disability, national origin,
    immigration status, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or marital status,
    income, military status, criminal history, or age. It holds up leaders from marginalized
    groups and centers the experiences of the disenfranchised. MAPC seeks to advance
    equity in the region through our organizational policies and project selection.

    text: 'In 2011, MAPC released “The State of Equity in Metro Boston,” a report
      providing compelling detail on inequality across many sectors, including housing,
      transportation, public health, and contaminated environments. In 2014, MAPC
      wrote “The State of Equity in Metro Boston: Policy Agenda” which attempted to
      provide recommendations of policies and implementation steps needed to address
      the disparities highlighted in the 2011 report. In February 2017, MAPC released
      a five-year update to the State of Equity indicators report, tracking the indicators
      over time.'

    anchor: process
    text: |-
      MAPC worked to ensure that the Policy Agenda and the input that went into this work, was done thoughtfully and intentionally. Our staff reviewed the 2014 Policy Agenda and assessed the progress made on those initial policy recommendations. MAPC organized an Advisory Committee to assist in framing and discussing what policy suggestions or topic areas must be included in this policy agenda update. It was important to MAPC and to this document, to invite voices from all different fields, backgrounds and experiences to our Advisory Committee. We held two meetings with the Advisory Committee. The first meeting was to provide an overview of the work MAPC had done on equity issues and to hear from those members on what equity issues most needed to be addressed. From this meeting, our staff compiled that list of issues and categorized them into the X # of topic issues of: . The second meeting was…..

      After our team completed the draft of policy recommendations, we had to pass it through our internal approval process which includes bringing it to our Legislative Committee, and then Executive Committee.

      Region
    anchor: essential-changes
    text: The current political climate at the federal level has become more partisan
      and grid locked over the past few months. This however, reinforces the importance
      of being politically involved at the municipal and state level. Policymakers
      now have a unique opportunity to take back some of the responsibility that at
      times was defaulted to federal entities.
- title: Previous SOE Policy Agenda
  anchor: previous-agenda
  text: "The 2014 Equity Policy Agenda was released to serve as an update to the MetroFuture
    Implementation Strategies and was based on the findings of the 2011 State of Equity
    in Metro Boston Indicators Report. The report made recommendations in three main
    categories:\n\n1)\tInvest in places\n2)\tInvest in people\n3)\tBuild more equitable
    public systems\n\nThe recommendations outlined in the report included planning,
    policy and funding changes at every level of government and steps that could be
    taken by the private sector and individual households. \n\nMany of the recommendations
    in the 2014 policy agenda highlighted a best practice area that a city or town
    could undertake and that required no legislative or policy change. While the best
    practices included are often the low-hanging fruit that can be easily accomplished,
    the previous policy agenda did not include policy strategies or specific policy
    actions for some of the biggest inequities facing our region, such as...\n\n###
    Progress and Next Steps\n\nIn the past few years, Massachusetts has made some
    strides towards addressing inequities. We have passed legislation that protects
    transgender individuals, provides wage fairness and pay equity for women, and
    we have modestly increased the minimum wage. We have increased the Earned Income
    Tax Credit in order to provide a refund to low-income families, and we have provided
    funding for programs that aim to curb youth violence. These are all important
    steps that we have taken to address pressing needs in the Commonwealth. \n\nBut
    there is more work to do because we have not moved the needle enough. Too many
    children in Massachusetts wake up hungry every day. Home affordability remains
    impossibly high for most families. Low-income families often have to choose between
    medicine and transportation. And some of our most marginalized residents often
    have very few options or paths to achieve success."
- title: Indicators Overview
  anchor: indicators
  text: "In 2011 MAPC released The State of Equity in Metro Boston, an inventory of
    cross- sectoral indicators that measured inequity in the region. Those indicators
    informed the creation of MAPC’s State of Equity Policy Agenda in 2014. MAPC’s
    2017 update to the State of Equity indicators report was published in February,
    2017 and forms the basis for the agenda put forth in this document. The following
    section summarizes major findings of the 2017 State of Equity indicators report.
    \n"
  subsections:
  - title: Diversity and Segregation
    anchor: diversity
    text: "Metro Boston is becoming more diverse every decade. In 1970, the region’s
      population was 5% people of color—Asian, Black, Latino, Native American, multiracial
      and other non-White residents; by 2010, that figure had grown to 28%. MAPC projects
      that by 2040 the region will be at least 40% people of color. The region has
      also grown in share of foreign-born residents, and as of 2011-2015, 20% of Metro
      Boston residents were born outside of the U.S. Even as it grows more diverse,
      the region remains racially and economically segregated. \nThe Dissimilarity
      Index, which measures the extent to which two groups are similarly distributed
      across the region, has shown decreasing Black – White segregation since 1980.
      However, the Dissimilarity Index for Latinos and Whites is now higher than it
      was in 1990, indicating a greater degree of segregation between the two groups.
      Other measures of economic segregation demonstrate that the region’s poorest
      households are becoming increasingly concentrated into low-income neighborhoods
      with little income diversity."
  - title: Housing
    anchor: housing
    text: People of color live in less-affluent neighborhoods than white households
      with comparable earnings. Odds are that a White household earning $78,000 per
      year lives in a neighborhood where the median household income of its neighbors
      is $72,000. Meanwhile, a Black household earning exactly the same is likely
      to live in a neighborhood where the median income is just $51,000. This disparity
      has increased substantially since 2000.
  - title: Health
    anchor: health
    text: "In 2011, we found that racial disparities in low birth weight eclipsed
      the differences attributable to education level, most notably for Black women.
      Based on 2005-2009 data, a college-educated Black woman was 40% more likely
      to have a low birth weight baby than a White woman without a high school diploma
      (8.5% among Black women with a college degree, 6.2% among White women with less
      than a high school degree). In 2017, with more recent data, we found that instances
      of low birth weight among Black women have declined slightly (from 10.4% in
      2005-2009 to 9.4% in 2010-2014 among Black women without a high school degree,
      and from 8.5% to 7.2% among Black women with a college degree), but the significant
      preexisting disparity means that those gains have not substantially bridged
      the gap between White women and Black women. \nRacial health disparities continue
      into childhood. In fact, in the case of childhood asthma, disparities have become
      more severe over time. Data from 2008-2012 show a 10% increase in overall youth
      asthma hospitalizations, compared to data from 2003-2007. This increase was
      driven by statistically significant increases in Black and Latino youth rates.
      Black youth in the more recent data experienced a rate of asthma hospitalization
      2.7 times higher than the regional average, and climbing. While the rates for
      Latino youth were closer to the regional average, they increased 22% over the
      five year interval."
  - title: Education
    anchor: education
    text: Standardized test performance improved across almost all demographic categories
      between 2009 and 2015, and the gains were largest for Black and Latino students.
      For the 10th Grade Math MCAS, the percent of Black and Latino students scoring
      Advanced or Proficient grew by 9 percentage points and 7 percentage points,
      respectively. The gap in scores between these groups and White students dropped
      by 5 points and 3 points, though the gaps remain large, at 26 points. These
      groups also saw even larger increases in their four-year graduation rates, and
      the gap in graduation rate with Whites fell by one quarter. Suspension rates
      in schools with more than 50% students of color are half of what they were in
      2006 – 2007, though they still remain twice as high as the average for all schools
      in the region.
  - title: Income
    anchor: income
    text: The most recent earnings data show that income polarization is increasing,
      and that this polarization disproportionately affects Black and Latino residents.
      The average income for the highest-earning fifth of households ($280,600) is
      18 times higher than average income for the lowest-income fifth of households
      ($15,800). That disparity has increased by two points since 2006. The highest-income
      fifth earns 15% more than it did in 2006, while the lowest-income fifth earns
      just 3% more. This can be attributed in part to wage polarization and the decline
      of the middle class. This polarization disproportionately affects Black and
      Latino households, whose median household incomes are less than half those of
      White and Asian households.
  - title: Homeownership
    anchor: homeownership
    text: Homeownership is one of the cornerstones of building wealth in America.
      MAPC’s 2011 report found that people of color—even those who earn a substantial
      income—face continued discrimination in choosing where to live. In particular,
      high-income applicants (those earning more than $118,000 per year) who are Black
      are more than twice as likely to be denied a mortgage as high-income borrowers
      who are White. For Black applicants, the denial rate dropped 4.7 percentage
      points, and for high-income Latino applicants the denial rate dropped 3.3 percentage
      points. While homeownership rates overall have dropped slightly in the last
      ten years, the declines have been most substantial for Black and Latino householders,
      whose homeownership rates (32% and 25%, respectively) are less than half of
      homeownership rates for White householders (68%).
  - title: Employment
    anchor: employment
    text: Metro Boston’s economy has been growing robustly since the Great Recession,
      and by the end of 2016 the Metro Boston’s official unemployment rate was 2.5%,
      according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). However, not everyone is
      benefiting equally from this growth. Labor force participation rate (the share
      of the working-age population working or looking for a job) for people with
      only a high school degree is 12 percentage points lower than the rate for those
      with a bachelor’s degree, and trending downward. The unemployment rate for workers
      who are Black is nearly 7 percentage points higher than the rate for workers
      who are White, and the Latino rate is nearly 5 points higher. The unemployment
      rate for people with a disability is more than ten percentage points higher
      than for people without a disability.
  - title: Criminal Justice
    anchor: criminal-justice
    text: Inequities in incarceration follow clear socioeconomic and geographic trends
      that carry significant implications for individuals, families, communities,
      and the region. For individuals, encounters with the criminal justice system
      can have long-term impacts on earning power and employability, as well as mental
      and physical health. The number of inmates in Massachusetts Department of Corrections
      (DOC) facilities statewide dropped by 12% from 2010 to 2016, and the disparities
      in incarceration rate for residents who are Black and Latino also declined,
      albeit slowly. Black and Latino inmates are severely over-represented in (DOC)
      facilities. Although the state population is 7% Black and 11% Latino, the state’s
      DOC inmates are 27% Black and 25% Latino. Native Americans residents, as of
      2016, have the highest rate of incarceration in the state’s prison system.
  - title: Senior
    anchor: senior
    text: "As the Baby Boomer generation ages, the region will experience substantial
      growth in the senior population, which may grow by 75% between 2010 and 2030.
      Above-average premature mortality rates for White and Black residents declined
      between 2003-2007 and 2008-2012, while rates for Asian, Latino, and Native American
      residents remained statistically unchanged. Black residents continue to have
      the highest premature mortality rate (348 per 100,000.) \nGrandparents responsible
      for their grandchildren have a poverty rate of more than 15%, double that of
      grandparents not responsible for their grandchildren. Older adults are more
      housing cost burdened (meaning that they pay more than 30% of their income on
      housing) than younger adults. Nearly 60% of renter households headed by an older
      adult are cost burdened, and more than a third of households where the homeowner
      is an older adult are cost burdened. Despite a 5% drop in the total number of
      housing cost burdened young home owners, the renter and owner housing cost burden
      rates for the elderly remained unchanged between 2005-2009 and 2011-2015."
- title: Guiding Principles for Policy Priorities
  anchor: principles
  text: "We developed a set of principles to help us[^another] highlight a key set
    of policy strategies, and related policy proposals, to act on in the next five
    years. The principles were developed based on input from a project Advisory Group,
    a review of relevant policy documents (e.g., PolicyLink’s All in Cities Toolkit,
    Minnesota Legislative Report Card on Racial Equity, City of Seattle’s Equity &
    Environment Agenda) and MAPC’s ongoing research into factors that are at the root
    of inequalities in the Metro Boston region. These principles layer on top of one
    another to form a kaleidoscope through which we see a composite rather than through
    one or only a few lenses when looking at how to address regional inequities.\n\n[^another]:
    This a footnote that comes in a different section of the site. "
  subsections:
  - title: Lead with Racial Equity
    anchor: racial-equity
    text: Our current policies often reflect a system that has been historically biased.
      For example, <<drug laws, redlining>>. Race has been a key, if not the main,
      bias present in many of the policies that have produced the disparities identified
      in the Greater Boston region. Accepting this history means that we must push
      forward changes that do not perpetuate policies that reflect past biases. Therefore,
      we seek policies that lead with a race equity frame and that do not exclusively
      attend only to this root cause of inequity. There are a number of other biases
      integrated into our existing policy landscape and that contribute, directly
      or indirectly, to discrimination experienced by other groups. We believe if
      these biases are rectified or removed, we will have a region that includes and
      support all residents, regardless of background.
  - title: Embrace Interdisciplinary Approaches
    anchor: interdisciplinary-approaches
    text: Existing disparities are rarely the result of inequities within one system.
      We support policy changes that weave together multiple disciplines, linking
      together different experiences and knowledge in support of solving common challenges
      (e.g., education, housing, and criminal justice). Several existing and emerging
      coalitions embrace this approach such as those leading the Great Neighborhoods
      Campaign and the Jobs not Jails Campaign. We believe policy changes coming from
      interdisciplinary groups represent the holistic actions necessary to eliminate
      inequitable outcomes.
  - title: Work Inside and Outside Existing Systems
    anchor: inside-outsidesystems
    text: 'Past policy work shows that incremental changes to existing systems can
      address inequalities. However working within existing systems can also allow
      root causes of inequity and past biases to persist or be perpetuated. In order
      to accelerate the realization of a more equitable region we look to policies
      that improve and reform existing systems as well as policies that dismantle
      or remove existing systems in order to create more equitable conditions. '
  - title: Scale Responses to Challenges
    anchor: scale
    text: Policy strategies should reflect the scale of challenge and the context
      of the inequality. We believe policies should reflect a necessary level of investment
      (e.g., funding, technical assistance, relief from statute, etc.) at the proper
      scale (regional, municipal, etc.) in the relevant sector (public or private).
      For example, in some cases, policies should empower cities and towns – individually
      or collectively – to address the disparities present in their communities. In
      other cases, policies will need to go beyond municipal boundaries to address
      causes of inequalities that are pervasive across regions and the state.
  - title: Move from Symptoms to Root Causes
    anchor: symptom-root
    text: Crises require immediate responses and we believe individuals in urgent
      need should receive assistance through programmatic and policy responses. At
      the same time, we also recognize crises – immediate and those that become chronic
      - are frequently symptoms of more systemic issues. The crises have root causes
      in our society, emanating from policies, norms, and practices of a dominant
      culture. Our policy agenda seeks to blend changes that provide short-term relief
      for individuals affected by crises with those that address the root causes of
      the disparities found in our neighborhoods, municipalities, and region.
  - title: Mitigate and Prevent Harm
    anchor: mitigate-harm
    text: Policies that aim to eliminate disparities by addressing inequities are
      meant to prevent or remove harm, rather than just to manage consequences. Therefore,
      we support policies that rectify the uneven distribution of benefits and burdens.
      We also look for new policy proposals that from the start assess potential inequitable
      effects and remedy those elements prior to passage. Evidence that blends evaluation
      results (e.g., “what works” resources) with lived experiences should form the
      basis of the updates to policies undergo in order to assure that future actions
      do not prolong or create harm for those already unfairly burdened.
- title: Policy Agenda 2017 – 2022
  anchor: policy-agenda
  text: "The policy agenda is made up of six different goals that, if achieved, will
    lead to greater equity across our region. If realized, this is what the Metro
    Boston region will look like in 2022:\n \n### 1.\tWe have inclusive, diverse communities
    where everyone can afford to live and thrive.\n### 2.\tWe have convenient and
    affordable options to access good jobs, schools and recreation.\n### 3.\tWe have
    good jobs and pathways to prosperity.\n### 4.\tWe solidify our foundation in education
    by offering affordable and quality education, from pre-school to college.\n###
    5.\tWe eliminate conditions and harmful environments that leave people sick or
    injured.\n### 6.\tWe have a public safety and justice system that protects residents
    of all backgrounds.\n\nUnder each of these goals, we highlight several strategies
    that will help to achieve the goals and under each strategy, we outline policy
    tactics that the legislature and the Administration should pass in order to make
    our region more equitable.\n\n> Example of Policy Agenda Layout, GOAL: WE HAVE
    INCLUSIVE, DIVERSE COMMUNITIES WHERE EVERYONE CAN AFFORD TO LIVE AND THRIVE(Policy
    Strategy) \nProtect tenants, increase the supply of homes that low-and middle-income
    families can afford to buy, and help all residents stay where they live\n(Policy
    Action) *Pass comprehensive zoning reform in order to encourage affordable housing
    production and eliminate discriminatory zoning practices.\n\nWe recognize that
    these goals, strategies and actions are related to each other. If, for example,
    we move towards a restorative justice system, this move will have a profound impact
    on workforce development, housing opportunities and public health outcomes. So,
    although the Policy Agenda identifies specific strategies and actions under a
    particular goal, the document serves as a cohesive, interdependent agenda, not
    as siloed policy change efforts. "

  - title: We have inclusive, diverse communities where everyone can afford to live
      and thrive.
    anchor: diversity-agenda
    text: "Metro Boston neighborhoods are becoming more economically segregated and
      racial desegregation lags significantly behind other metropolitan regions. The
      principle drivers of these trends are high housing prices, income disparities,
      and discriminatory lending and renting practices. Our current population and
      housing demand projections estimate that Metro Boston needs to build 435,000
      units of housing – mostly multifamily – between 2010 and 2040 to meet increasing
      demand and maintain current affordability. Unfortunately, we are falling far
      short, meaning that our region is becoming increasingly unaffordable for families.
      Families are increasingly cost-burdened in our region, spending well over 30%
      of their income on housing. \n\nSince 2012 the rate of cost burden has been
      trending up for the renter population and down for the homeowner population.
      The trend indicates a growing housing cost burden gap between homeowners and
      renters, increasing the vulnerability of the region’s renters who are disproportionately
      people of color. Neighborhoods with a high concentration of cost-burdened residents,
      especially renters, are at risk of rapid population turnover when housing costs
      rise slightly or when these households face economic setbacks. Tempering the
      rising cost of living will be a critical step in ensuring that all Metro Boston
      residents’ earnings are enough to make a home and remain financially stable.
      \n\nAt the same time, policies that encourage affordability do not necessarily
      promote inclusiveness. Immigrants, both documented and undocumented, are a critical
      component of Metro Boston’s economy and culture. Policies that exclude and ostracize
      immigrants reduce opportunities for them to engage civically, limiting the region’s
      progress. New punitive federal immigration policies put the onus on local governments
      to enact and enforce policies that make immigrants feel safe and that encourage
      them to engage with the people and places around them.\n\n### i.\tProtect tenants,
      increase the supply of homes that low-and middle-income families can afford
      to buy, and help all residents stay where they live\n\nThe lack of affordable
      housing options in Metro Boston negatively impacts the region’s ability to house
      our economically and ethnically diverse residential base and to support a thriving
      economy. Half the region’s renters and 30% of homeowners are cost burdened,
      meaning they spend more than 30% of their annual household income on housing.
      Policy responses to the affordability crisis include preserving the existing
      affordable housing supply, increasing the stock of housing, both affordable
      and market rate, and ensuring that below market-rate units are occupied by households
      with corresponding incomes. \n\n1. Pass comprehensive zoning reform in order
      to encourage affordable housing production and eliminate discriminatory zoning
      practices.\n\nMassachusetts has not updated its zoning laws in over 40 years.
      Municipalities across the Commonwealth use existing zoning laws as a way to
      prevent changes that would allow more affordable homes, condominiums, and apartments.
      \n\nAn update to the Commonwealth’s outdated zoning laws should require cities
      and towns to create neighborhoods of more affordable homes and should encourage
      municipalities to adopt bylaws or ordinances that require private developers
      to contribute when they are building market rate or luxury housing. Both of
      these tools will help to increase housing affordability in Metro Boston and
      across the Commonwealth.  \n\nMassachusetts has a long history of residential
      segregation, which can be traced to restrictive local zoning and permitting
      decisions. Comprehensive zoning reform in Massachusetts must promote inclusive
      neighborhoods where families with children and those with low- and moderate-incomes
      can find homes just as easily as those with more wealth or no dependents.\n\n1.
      Provide additional funds for preservation and production of affordable homes
      and continue to fund existing smart-growth incentive zoning.\n\nThe state should
      make financial investments that support municipalities with both production
      and preservation targets related to housing affordability. The state should
      continue to fund the Commonwealth’s smart growth incentive programs under Chapters
      40R and 40S so that cities and towns can feel confident that when they implement
      smart growth zoning overlays, possible impacts on school capacity will be meaningfully
      offset by state funding.\n\n> Emerging Practice: Managing Neighborhood Change
      \nLower-income households are disproportionately impacted by more negative outcomes,
      including housing cost burden and the risk of displacement, that are associated
      with new investment in housing, businesses, and infrastructure. Managing Neighborhood
      Change (MNC) is a data- and community-driven analysis and visioning process
      that engages residents in a community dialogue around neighborhood change, including
      what is welcome and what is cause for concern.  MNC draws on housing and demographic
      data, in addition to resident experiences, to provide strategies that mitigate
      the risks of change and more equitably distribute the benefits of new investments.
      \n\n1. Pass legislation aimed at increasing protections for renters.\n\nLegislation
      that would give tenants a right to counsel in eviction proceedings, require
      just-cause evictions, and offer tenants the right of first refusal in the event
      that their property is sold will help reduce housing insecurity. When tenants
      are protected in court proceedings, they are more likely to remain in their
      homes. Just-cause eviction laws protect tenants from unfair or discriminatory
      evictions, while a right of first refusal would give tenants an opportunity
      to purchase or assign their right to purchase a property, thereby increasing
      the likelihood that affordable home remains available in the community. Additionally,
      we should pass legislation that would give an income tax credit to landlords
      that rent at below-market rates, helping to incentivize these landlords to maintain
      rents that are affordable, especially for tenants whose wages have not increased,
      and to protect neighborhoods from the effects of gentrification. \nDetermine
      affordability based on median income by municipality\n\nCurrently, affordable
      housing eligibility is based on area median income (AMI) for the metropolitan
      statistical area (MSA). For Greater Boston, the MSA is geographically large
      and includes municipalities in Middlesex, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Plymouth
      Counties (and even parts of New Hampshire). Wealthy suburbs in this MSA drive
      up our median income, which ultimately means that most homes that deed-restricted
      as affordable are not actually within financial reach of many who live in Greater
      Boston. Determining affordability based on local median income will ensure that
      deed-restricted housing is available for those who need it most. \n\n### ii.\tEnsure
      residents with low incomes, people of color, and other protected classes have
      access to homes that suits their needs. \n\nDiscriminatory practices still limit
      homeownership. For instance, high-income applicants who are Black or Latino
      are denied a mortgage at rates that are 7 to 12 percentage points higher than
      applicants who are White and of similar economic status. Since homeownership
      gaps play a key role in the nation’s widening racial wealth gap,  the racial
      disparities in Metro Boston homeownership rates and home loan denial rates are
      limiting the capacity of Metro Boston residents of color and their municipalities
      to build wealth. \n\n1. Continue to enforce the Affirmatively Furthering Fair
      Housing rule.\n\nThe rule, promulgated under the Obama administration, required
      that jurisdictions that receive federal housing funding document barriers to
      integration and opportunity, but also that they detail and prioritize policies
      to eradicate these barriers. It is unclear how the current Department of Housing
      and Urban Development plans to enforce this rule in the short- and long-term,
      but every attempt should be made to preserve and prioritize it. At the local
      level, cities and towns should continue moving forward to develop Assessment
      of Fair Housing Plans. \n\n1. Cap tear-downs and enforce bedroom mix policies.\n\nAcross
      Greater Boston, small single-family homes are being torn down and replaced with
      larger, more expansive single-family properties. The new homes can gentrify
      neighborhoods quickly and displace current residents due to rising housing costs.
      At the same time, developers often disregard guidelines that require a bedroom
      mix that includes 3-bedroom units, instead opting to build studio, one and two-bedroom
      units. So as families are displaced from one neighborhood, there are few opportunities
      available to meet their family needs in others. Legislative action should cap
      the number of tear-downs that can occur within a given time period and require
      a specific bedroom mix for developments above a certain size (e.g., residential
      developments with more than 20 units).\n\n> BEST PRACTICE FOR MUNIS: Community
      Engagement and Outreach.\nPlanning processes should include significant community
      engagement and outreach to include participation from older adults, persons
      with disabilities, people of color, immigrants, people for whom English is not
      their primary language, and women.\n \nEquitable community engagement was a
      critical component of efforts to build on the vision for Downtown Lynn. MAPC
      partnered with the city of Lynn to convene a project team of advisors, conducted
      interviews with community leaders, gave presentations to community-based organizations,
      attended community events, talked with people we encountered on the street or
      at local businesses, interacted with community members using social media such
      as Facebook as well as via email, collected land use and property data using
      local volunteers, and hosted two public forums downtown. It is impractical to
      get input from every single resident, but this targeted approach provided an
      informed perspective to guide planning recommendations.\n\n\n### iii.\tEnsure
      that our communities are inclusive, representative and democratic \n\nIn order
      for residents living in Metro Boston to thrive and contribute to their fullest,
      they must feel a sense of inclusivity, belonging, and control. Voting must continue
      to be a right, preserved by removing barriers to voter registration that could
      limit turnout or participation. Voting rights could even be extended so that
      every resident of an area, regardless of citizenship status, could participate
      in local elections. Beyond voting, current immigration policies often prevent
      undocumented residents from meaningfully participating in regular civic processes.
      Yet undocumented immigrants produce incredible value for the region. If undocumented
      immigrants were deported, the region would face severe financial impacts; one
      estimate suggests Massachusetts would lose approximately $12 billion in economic
      activity and over 55,000 jobs.  \n\nOn the other hand, a more recent study estimates
      that securing lawful permanent residence for undocumented immigrants would generate
      over $259 million in state and local taxes, on top of the taxes that undocumented
      immigrants already pay.  \nUndocumented residents should be given protections
      to remain in the Commonwealth. \n\n1. Enact automatic voter registration throughout
      Massachusetts\n\nAutomatic voter registration enables a government agency, usually
      the Registry of Motor Vehicles, to automatically register a citizen upon state
      license or ID issuance or renewal, unless the person declines to do so. The
      citizen’s information is then sent to the appropriate election office for verification
      of voting eligibility. Currently, nine states and the District of Columbia have
      enacted automatic voter registration policies, as they serve to increase voter
      registration rates and help to eliminate existing barriers to voter registration.
      \n\n* Make Massachusetts a sanctuary state\nSanctuary state legislation would
      prohibit state and local resources from being used to enforce federal immigration
      laws and would prevent law enforcement officers from inquiring about an individual’s
      immigration status unless it is pertinent to the crime at issue. The legislation
      would further limit Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents from accessing
      information on booking lists or release dates unless a person is serving a sentence
      for a serious violent felony. Ensuring that our communities remain welcoming
      to all residents, regardless of where they come from or the circumstances of
      their arrival, is important to the long-term economic and social wellbeing of
      the entire Commonwealth. \n\n1. Create a process that allows non-citizen immigrants
      to vote in municipal elections\n\nAcross the country, several municipalities
      or counties have allowed non-citizen residents to vote in municipal elections,
      under the theory that all residents should be involved in municipal service
      delivery. Historically, until 1926, 40 states allowed non-citizens to vote in
      municipal and state elections, a policy that was reversed as nativist sentiments
      rose in the United States.  \n\n> BEST PRACTICE: Municipal Support and Outreach
      to Immigrant Residents\nCities and towns across the country offer training to
      municipal employees to learn how to engage with undocumented residents and with
      government agencies like the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. In
      Portland, Oregon the Human Resources Bureau, along with the Office of Equity
      and Human Rights and they City Attorney’s office developed a plan for training
      city workers how to respond to federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.
      \n\n1. Cultivate competency for service provision to residents who are lesbian,
      gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer\n\nAs a just and fair society, we seek
      and use approaches that allow for greater inclusion. In Metro Boston and Massachusetts,
      there are policy actions that can foster greater inclusion and responsiveness
      to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) residents. This includes
      partnering with representatives of the LGBTQ to build capacity in public and
      private service providers for greater cultural competency. An example of such
      a proposal is the An Act Relative to LGBT Awareness Training for Aging Services
      Provider, which would support development of a training program for the delivery
      of accessible and appropriate services to LGBTQ older adults and their caregivers.
      This act would prevent older LGBTQ residents from any need to hide their identity
      and receive care that is relevant and respectful.\n"
  - title: We have convenient and affordable options to access good jobs, schools
      and recreation
    anchor: affordability
    text: "Metro Boston’s residents depend on the region’s transportation system to
      connect them to school, work, services, and recreational activities. Despite
      the many ways residents of the region get around, transportation improvements
      have tended to promote one form of travel – driving alone – rather than emphasizing
      access to destinations regardless of how a person travels. As a result, many
      residents face substantial challenges when commuting to work, getting to the
      doctor’s office, or visiting friends. This is especially true for low-income
      households who do not own or cannot afford a vehicle, young people and older
      adults who cannot drive, and people with mobility impairments. Those individual
      and household constraints are compounded by historical and ongoing disparities
      in transit service available for low-income communities and communities of color.\n \n###
      Expand transportation options, particularly for underserved populations and
      communities of color, and decrease transportation costs for cost-burdened households.
      \n\nThe region’s commuters of color spend more time commuting than their White
      counterparts. Without a range of convenient transportation options, particularly
      public transit and safe pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, marginalized
      communities have limited mobility options and yet are likely to experience disproportionate
      impacts from vehicular emissions. \n\nThese same communities often spend a disproportionate
      percentage of their household incomes on transportation costs. As MBTA, Commuter
      Rail and event Regional Transit costs continue to rise, we have seen a steady
      decrease in the real dollar value of the gas tax since 1996. Equitable transportation
      means providing a range of travel options to low-income communities and communities
      of color, all of which are affordable, reliable, safe and sustainable.\n \n1.
      Enact Regional Transportation Ballot Initiatives to support active transportation
      investments\n\nThis legislation would allow a municipality or group of municipalities
      to raise additional local money for transportation projects via a ballot initiative,
      giving voters a more direct role in the transportation funding process and creating
      a lock box of funds for specific investments. In many communities across our
      region, we expect that these funds would be used to create alternative transportation
      investments, or to increase investments in the existing system. At the same
      time, a frequent criticism of this local option funding mechanism is that it
      will only truly be available to wealthier communities. If it is passed, the
      Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) should ensure that lower-income
      communities have more access to statewide resources. \n\n2. Implement road-pricing
      systems that incentivize public transit use\n\nSeveral cities across the United
      States have implemented congestion-pricing schemes. While congestion-pricing
      could be regressive, if implemented here, the region has the opportunity to
      devise a strategy that funnels new money directly to public transit and offers
      exemptions to vehicle-dependent low-income families. \n\n3. Implement low-income
      fares for the MBTA, Commuter Rail and RTAs\n\nThe MBTA could implement a low-income
      fare policy whereby riders pay fares on a sliding scale based on their income.
      Additionally, the MBTA should create a fare-capping program for riders who pay
      per trip, rather than for a daily or monthly pass, and ensure that they don’t
      pay more than the cost of the currently offered passes.\n{:.under} \n\n> BEST
      PRACTICE: Bus Rapid Transit Pilots Bus Rapid Transit pilot programs are springing
      up along three key corridors in the MBTA service area. Bus Rapid Transit is
      often seen as a more cost-friendly alternative to building new rail corridors
      along some of our busiest transit routes. Continuing to expand the existing
      pilot program in low-income communities and communities of color could help
      to address inequities in our existing transit system. MAPC will continue to
      play a role in helping the MBTA to determine which corridors should be prioritized
      and to determine the impact of removing parking to accommodate a new dedicated
      bus lane.  \n\n### Adopt equitable decision-making frameworks for transportation
      planning and project development\n\nAn essential part of everyday life for most
      is travel from home to work or to goods and services. The region’s transportation
      systems is the foundation of making commute and utilitarian travel possible
      and the system is sustained through public- and private-sector investment. The
      transportation system that we have is also the result of public- and private-sector
      planning processes, which can tend to focus more heavily on areas that are undergoing
      economic growth and on areas where communities have the capacity to participate
      in decision-making. Since the system serves all in the region, decisions should
      not only favor a few or overly burden specific groups of people, such as households
      of color who are disproportionately burdened by higher transportation costs
      and longer commute times. We can create a more equitable system through greater
      investments in active transportation modes and leading more inclusive planning
      processes. \n\n1. Create and enforce developer mitigation policies that direct
      more funding to walking, biking and public transit infrastructure.\n\nThrough
      the development review process, cities and towns should require developers to
      conduct impact studies and manage congestion impacts by making bicycle, pedestrian
      and transit investments. Legislation to assist municipalities, the MassDOT and
      the MBTA create a framework that would direct (additional) developer mitigation
      funds to support transit service and walking and biking infrastructure would
      ensure that such investments are no longer one-off occurrences and are a regular
      investment from new development, especially in locations that rely more heavily
      on non-vehicular travel for daily travel.\n\n> Emerging Practice: Racial equity
      impact assessments, Racial equity impact assessments analyze the impact of budget
      and policy decisions on racial and ethnic groups and identify ways to mitigate
      the possible consequences of these decisions. They seek to root out bias while
      promoting equity, inclusion, and opportunity. These assessments can be applied
      to any policy or decision making process. King County, Washington created an
      Equity Impact Review (EIR) toolkit for informing more equitable budgets, policies,
      and decision making. The King County Department of Transportation uses it to
      make equitable decisions on service reductions or enhancements. The Parks Department
      uses the EIR to more fairly distribute parks, open space, trails, and Farmer’s
      Market by race, income, and language spoken. The county also applied the EIR
      during the creation of their 2012 budget, which resulted in extra allocations
      to truancy prevention, youth programming in diverse low income areas, and economic
      development opportunities in low income communities.\n \n2. Offer technical
      assistance funding to support design for low-income communities.\n\nThe Transportation
      Improvement Program (TIP) is the process by which federal transportation dollars
      are allocated to cities and towns in Massachusetts. The current scoring criteria
      favorably views projects that advance equity and support environmental justice
      communities, but requires that projects be at 25% design before they are submitted
      to the TIP. This can be a significant cost burden for communities and can create
      a barrier for those communities that already have transit-dependent residents
      or have transit deserts. A program to increase technical assistance to those
      communities to help them reach 25% design could help level the playing field
      for access to federal transportation dollars. \n\n3. Update Project Selection
      Criteria to more holistically consider existing conditions and differences in
      outcomes \n\nTransportation agencies such as Metropolitan Planning Organizations
      (MPOs), and often municipal public works departments, use a set of project evaluation
      criteria to identify priority transportation-related capital investments, given
      constrained financial situations and long range plans. While some progress has
      occurred, many selection criteria continue to prioritize capital and maintenance
      activities that support single occupant automobile travel. \nFortunately, there
      are more resources available that allow consideration of a broader set of factors
      and impacts so that criteria promote more equitable outcomes. MPOs and cities
      and towns can put in place policies that place more emphasis on project characteristics
      such as proximity of high volume roadways to residential and education uses,
      socioeconomic context, and access to employment as well as on estimated project
      outcomes on factors like greenhouse gas emissions, displacement risk, injuries,
      and vegetative cover.\n> \nBEST PRACTICES: Complete Streets, Complete Streets
      are roadways that are safe, accessible and comfortable for all users, regardless
      of age, physical ability, income, or how they choose to travel: by transit,
      on foot, by bike or public transit. Complete Streets increase safety, promote
      economic development, and enhance public safety. MassDOT offers a special funding
      incentive program to cities and towns that adopt Complete Streets policies.
      MAPC has helped many municipalities to write Complete Streets policies and bicycle
      and pedestrian network plans. To date, 70 cities and towns have registered for
      the MassDOT Complete Streets program, with 44% of those cities and towns serving
      populations at or below the median household income.\n"
  - title: We have good jobs and pathways to prosperity.
    anchor: report-prosperity
    text: "While the Metro Boston’s regional economy has been growing robustly since
      the Great Recession, not everyone has benefitted equally from that growth. Participation
      rates for people with a high school degree are 12 percentage points lower than
      the rates for those with a bachelor’s degree, and trending downward. The unemployment
      rate for workers who are Black is nearly 7 percentage points higher than the
      rate for workers who are White, and the Latino rate is nearly 5 points higher.
      The unemployment rate for people with a disability is more than ten percentage
      points higher than for people without a disability. \n\nA good job can be defined
      as employment that respects workers’ rights, provides opportunity for upward
      mobility, ensures safe working conditions, pays a living wage, is free from
      any type of discrimination or harassment, and provides meaningful benefits.
      Well-paying jobs represent the difference between economic security and financial
      instability, and studies show that good jobs have a direct tie to educational
      attainment opportunities among families and the ability to live in healthier
      homes and neighborhoods. \n\nMAPC’s work on income inequality seeks to advance
      policies that improve the economic vitality of all by supporting financial independence
      for residents, beginning with those who have the greatest economic needs in
      our region. \n\n### i.\tRemove barriers to employment\n\nIn the Metro Boston,
      workers without college degrees, communities of color, and workers with a disability
      are disproportionately under-employed and unemployed. Many workplace policies
      continue to put up artificial barriers for employees in these demographics.
      Policy shifts could have a profound impact on employees who are often underpaid
      and working in inflexible situations. Additionally, Criminal Offender Record
      Information (CORI) forms continue to be a barrier for individuals who enter
      or return to the workforce after a criminal case. It is not only an employment
      barrier, but can also limit an individual’s eligibility for certain state assistance
      programs and their economic independence and socio-economic mobility. More attention
      is paid to CORI reform under the goal. \n\n1. Paid Family and Medical Leave\n\nA
      current proposal in the MA Legislature would allow employees who are eligible
      under the current Massachusetts Parental Leave Act and federal Family and Medical
      Leave Act to take paid time off to recover from a serious illness or injury,
      to care for a seriously ill or injured family member, or to care for a new child.
      If passed, the legislation would provide critical financial security for employees
      who need to serve as a caretaker, extend the length of leave available to employees,
      and ensure that workers can keep their jobs once they return from leave. \n\nPaid
      Family and Medical Leave has the potential to particularly improve outcomes
      for women, minority and low-wage workers. This population is less likely to
      receive wage replacement when they take time off to attend to a personal illness
      or to care for a family member; they are also more likely to cut back on spending,
      dip into savings, and apply for public assistance since they cannot go without
      pay,. Employees without paid leave are also more likely to leave the workforce,
      which stifles professional growth and exacerbates wage inequality.\n\n1. Increase
      the minimum wage to $15 per hour, and tie the increase to inflation\n\nUnder
      the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the federal minimum wage for covered nonexempt
      employees is $7.25 per hour effective July 24, 2009. Many states also have minimum
      wage laws. Where an employee is subject to both the state and federal minimum
      wage laws, the employee is entitled to the higher minimum wage rate. The minimum
      wage in Massachusetts is set at $11.00 per hour.\n\nThe declining value of the
      minimum wage is one of the primary causes of wage inequality between low and
      middle-income workers. The minimum wage should be increased to $15 an hour and
      be tied to the consumer price index to ensure that wages remain stable. In addition,
      the state should require companies to pay tipped worker $15 an hour and create
      exceptions to the minimum wage law to allow for an adjusted wage for employees
      between the ages of 16 and 18. \n\n> BEST PRACTICE: Improve technical employment
      opportunities for women and people of color\nWomen and people of color are underrepresented
      in the construction and STEM fields. Many of the Commonwealth’s newest jobs
      are in the technology field, but we need to create a greater talent pipeline
      between educational institutions and the workforce. Many programs throughout
      the Commonwealth provide mentoring opportunities for young women interested
      in STEM and Building Trade Skills and we should better connect employers to
      these potential employees. Additionally workforce development training opportunities
      should be located near transit and should have flexible childcare opportunities.
      \  \n\nIn July 2017, Governor Baker signed the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act,
      which prohibits workplace and hiring discrimination related to pregnancy and
      nursing and requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations for expectant
      and new mothers in the workplace. \n\nIn December 2017, Boston City Council
      signed an Ordinance on Equity in Opportunity for City Contracting, which mandates
      active outreach to businesses owned by people of color and women, it requires
      all requests for proposals issued by the City of Boston include a rating of
      diversity and inclusion plans as evaluation criteria, and it creates a quarterly
      reporting requirement so that city government can hold themselves accountable.
      \n\n### i.\tIncrease access to business ownership and employment/financial independence\n\n\nSmall
      business creation is usually heralded as an opportunity for Americans to pursue
      their entrepreneurial spirit and provide jobs for their community. Unfortunately
      access to state and local resources to start a business are not necessarily
      accessible to everyone. Whether prospective entrepreneurs face bank loan discrimination,
      speak a foreign language, face difficulties with talent retention or lack financial
      resources, the region needs to do more to increase business ownership. We must
      incentivize the creation of small businesses and support objectives aimed at
      worker development. \n\n1. Recapitalize the Workforce Competitiveness Trust
      Fund\n\nThe Workforce Competitiveness Trust Fund, operated out of the Commonwealth
      Corporation, invests in programs that train and place unemployed or underemployed
      workers. Between 2007 and 2011, the Fund supported 31 partnerships, serving
      more than 6,700 youth and adults. The Fund supports individuals who might rely
      on public benefits, have health problems or disabilities, or who haven’t completed
      school. The Fund provides support to residents for employment opportunities,
      but works with Massachusetts businesses to secure employees. The fund used to
      receive $18 million but its funding has dipped in recent years. The legislature
      should fully fund this important program. \n\n1. Technical assistance programs
      and revolving loan funds that provide access to capital for small businesses\n\nMassachusetts
      established the Small Business Technical Assistance (SBTA) program in 2006 in
      order to help small businesses succeed in underserved communities in the commonwealth,
      particularly low- to moderate-income communities and communities of color. The
      program works by providing funding to not-for-profit grantees, largely consisting
      of Community Development Corporations (CDCs) or Community Development Financial
      Institutions (CDFIs), who then offer a range of technical assistance (TA) and
      financial services to small business clients. The entrepreneurial and employment
      opportunities supported by the SBTA program helps reduce deeply entrenched economic
      disparities that put traditionally underserved populations at risk for worse
      economic and health outcomes.\n\n1. Technical assistance and small business
      development programs for worker-owned cooperatives\n\nWorker-owned cooperatives are
      companies owned and managed by employees who share decision-making powers and who control the profits produced
      through their labor. According to a recent study, about 60 percent of new cooperatives
      worker-owners since 2010 are people of color and nearly 70% are women.  Co-ops provide
      an alternative to traditional corporations in many regards not least of which
      is that profits remain with the worker-owners and more likely in the surrounding
      community. The state and municipalities can help co-operatives form by providing
      bridge financing and creating predictable processes to establish them as well
      as technical assistance and spaces that help the cooperatives establish themselves.\n\n###
      iii.\tFacilitate intergenerational wealth transfer among low- and middle-income
      families\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s 2015 Report titled
      The Color of Wealth, “Nonwhite households have only a fraction of the net worth
      attributed to white households. While white households have a median wealth
      of $247,500, Dominicans and U.S. blacks have a median wealth of close to zero.
      Of all nonwhite groups for which estimates could be made, Caribbean black households
      have the highest median wealth with $12,000, which is only 5 percent of the
      wealth attributed to white households in the Boston MSA [Metropolitan Statistical
      Area].”\n\nThis economic data demonstrates that barriers to employment and business
      ownership, as well as homeownership, have real consequences on an individual’s
      ability to save money, own assets and pass them on to their families. We must
      pass legislation and support programs that facilitate low-income and middle-income
      households to accumulate wealth and assets. \n\n1. Increase the Earned Income
      Tax Credit and expand its eligibility.\n\nThe Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)
      is a benefit to working families earning low- to moderate-incomes (individuals
      earning less than $15,000; families with children earning less than $50,000).
      The EITC should be increased, so that more people can take advantage of this
      important benefit. Research shows that the EITC has increased employment, boosting
      long-term earnings and future retirement benefits. The benefit should also be
      expanded to include individuals who meet the income requirements but don’t have
      children, and should be based on personal instead of family income.\n\n1. Pass
      legislation aimed at curbing the “Cliff Effect” for individuals and families
      receiving state benefits\n\nThe “Cliff Effect” occurs when an individual or
      family receiving state benefits sees a sharp decline in those benefits as income
      increases. While many state benefit programs currently have an income or employment
      requirement, benefits generally decrease as income increases. The unintended
      result is either a disincentive toward economic mobility or a person working
      harder, with less financial stability. Program assistance should be tapered
      as individuals or families increase their incomes, rather than cutting off assistance
      at particular income levels. The state should also pass legislation that lifts
      the welfare benefit cap for families who have a child while receiving state
      assistance. \n\n1. The federal child tax credit is intended to reduce cost related
      to raising a child among working families with low household incomes and the
      working class. The current child tax credit is $1,000 per child and it works
      to reduce the taxes among families who have the least. Given rising household
      costs and stalled wages among lower-paying jobs, an expanded federal tax credit
      would help families with children avoid material hardships which can force them
      to choose between essentials like heating, food, and rent. \n\n> BEST PRACTICE:
      Improve financial literacy programs for low-income households\nIn 2016, Mayor
      Toni Harp of the City of New Haven launched the Financial Empowerment Commission
      with the vision of building financial stability and knowledge amongst New Haven
      low income residents. This initiative was enabled by a planning grant called
      the “Next Generation Financial Empowerment Grant” from the Cities for Financial
      Empowerment Fund (CFE Fund).  To develop recommendations, the Mayor appointed
      a community advisory group to the collect and share insights on the financial
      lives of New Haven residents. Based on the findings from the advisory group,
      the commission chose two target populations that would most benefit from financial
      empowerment interventions. \n•\tLow- wage households earning less than 200%
      of the federal poverty guidelines, and focus on those earning less than 100%
      of the guidelines.  \n•\tThe re- entry of formerly incarcerated individuals
      into the community. \nThe Commission was tasked with drafting recommendations
      for a strategic plan identifying short and long term goals and implementation
      strategies. The recommendations included building a financial empowerment network
      with community based organizations to connect and identify individuals in the
      target populations and referring them to services and resources. Also, creating
      a Financial Empowerment Center that would be staffed with a full-time financial
      coach/ counselor. With these recommendations the Mayor and Commission hope to
      foster a culture of financial empower for both the target populations and all
      residents of New Haven.\n\n1. Enact Tenant First Right Purchase Options for
      Multi-Family Buildings\n\nResidents can experience displacement as residential
      buildings are sold to new ownership. This can be particularly harmful for properties
      that have provide affordable homes for households earning low- and moderate-incomes.
      A Tenant First Right Purchase Option protection, when adopted by a municipality,
      would stipulate that owners of residential properties must provide current tenants
      an chance to purchase the property at a fair market price and terms before the
      owner can transfer the property to a third party. When coupled with a low-interest
      loans, the first right purchase option provides an avenue to homeownership,
      and wealth creation, for low- and moderate-income families. \n\n\n"
  - title: We unlock the potential in our children by providing affordable and quality
      education
    anchor: report-education
    text: "In Massachusetts, we place a high value on learning and education. We have
      prospered due to our high levels of educational performance and public and private
      academic institutions. While many have benefited from the lifelong learning
      opportunities found in our region, not all do—[statistics about Black and Latino
      educational attainment gaps and/or Black, Latino, ELL, and children with disabilities
      MCAS gaps]. Consequently, we have set [these] children, teenagers, and adults
      on a path that narrows their chances to reach their full potential and that
      perpetuates inequalities in our region. Since [a person with a college degree
      is X times more likely to be employed and is likely to make X more money annually,
      than the same person without a college degree] earnings and economic independence
      are highly related to educational attainment, we limit their prosperity and
      a substantial return on investment to the region. There is a considerable amount
      of work and change necessary to provide quality learning opportunities for the
      people who are in most need and facing the greatest disparities.  \n\n### i.\tProvide
      children with supportive learning environments from birth\n\nResearch shows
      that children who start school ready to learn have better educational outcomes
      throughout primary school and are then able to achieve greater success in high
      school. Readiness to learn begins even before students enter elementary and
      secondary education as an infant’s health and environment is closely associated
      with the health and socioeconomic characteristics of its birth parents. It is
      linked as well with the health status of mothers who may be more prone to pre-term
      and low birth weight births when exposed to social and environmental stressors.
      Therefore, policy action can supply parents and children most in need with support
      from pregnancy through early childhood to improve lifelong outcomes.\n\n1. Increase
      funding for Head Start programs\n\nOur congressional delegation should build
      on their commitment to early education by increasing their support for the federally
      funded Head Start program.  Over the past fifty years, Head Start has provided
      comprehensive early education and support services in the areas of health and
      dental care, nutrition, special education, parent skill workshops and social
      services for children ages three to five and their families. We recommend that
      the increase in funding be dedicated not only to expanding access to the program
      to ensure that more children can benefit but also to develop and retain a quality
      workforce. \n\n1. Pass legislation to fund Universal Pre-K\n\nLegislation has
      been filed to help close the achievement gap and ensure that all Massachusetts
      children have the opportunity to succeed in school and in life. The legislation
      builds on the Commonwealth’s strong policy foundation for early education, including
      the ongoing work of the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE).
      The legislation would capitalize on existing grant programs and might even help
      to reduce existing costs for special education and social services.\n\n> Best
      Practice: Harlem Children’s Zone \nThe Harlem Children’s Zone (HCZ) is a cradle
      to college model serving thousands of youth in Harlem, NY. The organization
      offers a holistic approach, supporting their clients in educational advancement,
      family stabilization, housing security, healthy lifestyles, and social services.
      The HCZ seeks “to address the entire child and entire community of the child”
      \ including fellow residents, stakeholders, and institutions.  The HCZ boasts
      a variety of programs for youth of all ages to participate in, from formal enrollment
      in Pre-K to High School to after school and enrichment programs. A Harvard Study
      in 2009 concluded that the HCZ’s Promise Academy and additional HCZ support
      programs had closed “the black-white achievement gap in mathematics and [reduced]
      it by nearly half in English Language Arts.”\n\n\n### ii.\tEnsure our institutional
      learning environments are safe and welcoming to all students no matter their
      income or race\n \nOur schools prepare children and adolescents for the future
      and we all lose out when our educational environments stunt, rather than foster
      growth. We continue to see outcomes that are unequal, as youth who are Black
      and Latino do not experience similar educational outcomes as their White peers.
      Disciplinary actions in school settings serve to push students of color away
      from our educational systems. We need to continue to push for those positive
      changes that expand support for all students so that differences in outcomes
      do not persist. \n\n1. End criminalization of disruptive behavior in schools\n\nThe
      school-to-prison pipeline is a concept that describes repeated and escalating
      interactions of youth with school disciplinarians, the juvenile justice system,
      and the criminal justice system, ultimately leading to incarceration. Such interactions
      disproportionately affect students of color, low-income students, and special
      education students. Studies have shown that these students are not necessarily
      more prone to misbehavior than their peers; but policies and discrimination
      make them more likely be punished than White students. A proposed bill - An
      Act Decriminalizing Non-Violent and Verbal Student Misconduct - would help to
      dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline by limiting the use of criminal enforcement
      activities for nonviolent misconduct in schools, allowing the steps of arrest
      and prosecution only when other more appropriate school-based approaches have
      been tried and not succeeded. \n\n1. Pass “Breakfast After the Bell” legislation\n\nTwo
      out of three K-12 students that qualify for free and reduced lunch aren’t eating
      it. The stigma of the existing free breakfast programs and the logistical challenges
      of getting to school early keep students from participating in breakfast-before-the-bell
      programs. This bill requires that high poverty schools serve breakfast to all
      students at the beginning of the instructional day, or “after the bell.” Passage
      of this bill would extend existing benefits to over 260,000 students at approximately
      600 Massachusetts schools. \n\n1. Address inequitable state funding formulas
      to increase support the state’s highest-need K-12 schools\n\nIn 2015, the Department
      of Elementary and Secondary Education changed the methodology used to count
      the number of low-income students and counted only those students that already
      participate in existing state benefit programs like SNAP, TAFDC, foster care
      or MassHealth. This change led to lower state funding to schools because it
      does not accurately capture the actual number of low-income students. This new
      method misses many students who are in the school system and are economically
      disadvantaged because it fails to account for those low-income students who
      are not accessing social services, which often include homeless youth and newly
      arrived immigrants. The current approach to counting low-income students leaves
      some of our most financially challenged communities with a significant financial
      gap. Adequate funding is critical to our communities and will ensure they receive
      the funding necessary to provide all students with education they deserve.\n\n###
      iii.\tMake college accessible to all\t\n\nA college degree continues to be associated
      with higher earnings and sustained labor force participation. We see increasingly
      that most job opportunities seek a minimum of a college degree from prospective
      job-seekers. Unfortunately, our region continues to see inequalities among those
      who have a bachelor’s degree or higher. We can make greater investments in opportunities
      for Black and Latino populations in order to close these gaps. We must create
      more routes to a college degree, especially for those whose income is limited
      or who are looking to move beyond mid-skill job opportunities. \n\n1. Free tuition
      at community colleges\n\nFree tuition at community colleges for residents that
      have graduated high school or have completed their GEDs, would remove a barrier
      to individuals seeking to advance their career. Educational attainment is a
      strong indicator of how much money an individual will make and has long-term
      economic impacts as well. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,
      the median usual weekly earnings for someone with a high school diploma is $692,
      but for an Associate’s degree and Bachelor’s degree, is $892 and $1,156 respectively.
      The reverse trend is seen with unemployment rates, with higher unemployment
      rates correlating with lower educational attainment.\nIn 2017, Boston Mayor
      Marty Walsh and Governor Charlie Baker rolled out the Boston Bridge, a continuation
      of Boston’s Tuition-Free Community College Plan. The Plan “pays for the costs
      of tuition and mandatory fees that are not covered by the Pell Grant” for low
      income city residents for up to three years of community college. The Boston
      Bridge is a pilot program that would allow these same students to then transfer
      into a four-year program through the state’s Commonwealth Commitment Program.\nCalifornia,
      Kentucky, Missouri, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee have all passed legislation
      or adopted pilot programs to provide some form of tuition free community college,
      while other states like Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, and South Dakota have
      free tuition at community colleges for targeted fields of study.\n\n1. In-state
      tuition for undocumented youth\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, there
      are 210,000 undocumented immigrants in Massachusetts, including over 8,000 DACA
      recipients. DACA, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival, was created in June
      2012 by President Obama and enabled undocumented individuals brought to the
      U.S. as children to receive Social Security numbers, temporary work permits,
      and protection from deportation, as long as they met age requirements, demonstrated
      physical presence, met educational or military service requirements, and passed
      a criminal background check. In 2012, Governor Patrick took Executive Action
      that allowed DACA recipients to be eligible for in-state tuition at the 29 public
      colleges and universities, as long as they met the Board of Higher Education’s
      residency requirements. While this is still the current policy in Massachusetts,
      recent federal actions require that the Commonwealth pass legislation to extend
      in-state tuition at public higher education institutions to current DACA recipients
      and allow other undocumented immigrants who are not DACA eligible to enroll
      in college as in-state students. Full implementation of in-state tuition for
      undocumented immigrants could result in an additional $7 million of annual revenue
      to the public university system. \n\n> Emerging Practice: Wraparound service
      for first in family college attendees\nFirst generation college students, particularly
      first generation college students from communities of color, face emotional,
      lifestyle, and financial barriers on their path to graduation. As a result many
      aspiring college students either turn down acceptances or matriculate and quickly
      drop out. Wraparound support services for students from underrepresented populations
      seek to address these poor outcomes. A student in wraparound services receives
      case management services, housing assistance, academic and career support, and
      solutions to basic needs. \n\nOne example is Florida State University’s US Program
      that serves youth experiencing foster care, homelessness, and relative care.
      The US Program enrolled its first cohort in 2012 and as of 2016 participants
      had a 91% retention rate and a 3.01 grade point average. "
  - title: 'We eliminate harmful conditions and environments beginning with the people
      and places that have the greatest health needs. '
    anchor: report-environment
    text: "It is much easier for a person to stand up and move forward when that person
      does not have to carry a heavy burden, whether it be financial, physical, psychological,
      or a combination of each. Unfortunately, our region is home to many communities
      whose environments stand as barriers to their desire for healthier, more resilient,
      and economically stable lives. Under-investment in communities of color has
      created structural barriers to success and new programs, like those around clean
      energy investments, have frequently passed over these places due to lack of
      understanding and capacity. In particular, communities of color are subject
      to environmental disparities, living in neighborhoods located close to densely
      congested highways or home to hazardous power plants, which has forced the communities
      to deal with these existing issues instead of on new opportunities and innovations.
      We believe that for all people to thrive, regardless of background, policies
      must eliminate these intrinsic barriers and be more cognizant of how we ensure
      all resident of the region can be prepared to meet the environmental challenges
      to come.\n\n### i.\tEnhance community resilience and sustainability to meet
      the present and future challenges\n\nWe must make investments that strengthen
      communities by better preparing individuals and families to deal with natural
      hazards like floods and heat waves as well as meet the new challenges we expect
      from these natural events. We can build a more resilient region by making structural
      investments that foster community resiliency as well as positioning our residents
      to benefit from new technologies that are intended to increase economic and
      energy security.\n\n1. Expand the Mass Solar Loan Program to more effectively

      records.\n\nExpand the Mass Solar Loan Program to more effectively reach low-income
      households that are credit invisible or have unscored credit records.\n> \nBest
      Practice: Climate Justice Initiatives\nClimate Justice recognizes that the negative
      effects of climate change fall most harshly on those who contributed the least
      to its causes, low income communities and communities of color. As the climate
      changes these populations will be the first to face negative health outcomes,
      financial hardships and social and cultural disruptions. Climate Justice Proponents
      seek to spread these burdens of climate change as well as the benefits addressing
      climate change will create. \n\nIn 2012 California created a model for climate
      justice legislation passing a bill that allocates resources to the communities
      most hurt by climate change. Twenty-five percent of proceeds from California’s
      Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund will pay for projects in disadvantaged communities,
      which they identify through the CalEnviroScreen, a screening methodology used
      to identify communities that are burdened by multiple sources of pollution.
      \   \n\n1. Protect at-risk populations from current and future environmental
      hazards.\n\nThe legislature is currently considering a proposal that would require
      that all residents who live in the Commonwealth have equal environmental justice,
      and all executive Secretariats develop policies and strategies to achieve environmental
      justice. This would include the appointment of a Director of Environmental Justice
      at the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs.  The proposal also
      creates a supplemental fund to support environmentally beneficial projects in
      low-income communities. The proposal is particularly important because we often
      see low-income communities living in climate-vulnerable locations. As superstorms
      and chemicals impact our municipalities, we have to make sure that all residents
      live somewhere they can expect to remain safe from climate hazards. \n\n1. Provide
      a comprehensive energy efficiency program offering to effectively meet the needs
      of moderate-income customers and renters across the Commonwealth.\n\nThe low-income
      energy efficiency program in Massachusetts is a leader in the clean energy field,
      but it is limited to serving households at or below 60% of Area Median Income.
      The energy efficiency Program Administrators were instructed to roll out a moderate-income
      offer, but the impacts of this will be difficult to measure. We must continue
      to engage in robust advocacy to ensure that the needs of historically underserved
      populations are met by the state’s energy efficiency programs at the same time
      as we identify and approval additional program funding mechanisms, especially
      for moderate income customers. \n\n> Emerging Practice: Just Transition\nJust
      Transition is the practice of supporting vulnerable populations in the face
      of massive economic shifts both due to and to avoid climate change and loss
      of biodiversity. It is in response to the history of chaotic, harmful economic
      restructurings that have overwhelmingly affected low income communities of color.
      Just Transition ensures that the cost of these beneficial changes is not borne
      by a select few.\n\nJust Transition solutions are as diverse as the problem
      it hopes to solve. The Black Mesa Water Coalition in Arizona and their Just
      Transition Campaign is a leading example of community activism and involvement.
      The group has succeeded in shutting down polluting facilities and replacing
      them with clean community controlled sourced of energy and green economy jobs.
      In Boulder, Colorado the Just Transition Collaborative notes that non-homeowners
      lack the opportunity to invest in solar and may bear the brunt of shifts in
      utilities. The City of Boulder, per a recommendation of the Just Transition
      Collaborative, is designing a program to provide energy subsidies for the elderly,
      and low-income individuals, particularly low-income individuals of color. \n\n1.
      Establish and fund a pilot program for shared electric vehicle services in Environmental
      Justice communities.\n\nLow-income families of color are less likely to own
      a vehicle than white and high-income families. Additionally, households in the
      lower third of the income range dedicate more of their household income to transportation
      costs than the upper third of the national income range. Providing shared mobility
      services with electric vehicles that have zero tail pipe emissions within environmental
      justice communities can potentially improve access to opportunity and improve
      local air quality through reduced emissions. The state will need to allocate
      significant new resources to support a successful program. Along with other
      New England states, Massachusetts is currently considering a regional cap and
      trade program for transportation-related emissions. If this passes, it could
      be a significant new source of funding available to reinvest in programs and
      initiatives designed to reduce emissions from the transportation sector.\n\n###
      ii.\tEliminate food insecurity among families\nFamilies in our region are healthier
      when they do not have to worry if they will have access to nutritious foods.
      Unfortunately, many children and adults in the Metro Boston region do not have
      access to enough nutritious food to support an active and healthy life, and
      as a result we see many resulting health issues. We can reduce these health
      issues by focusing on eliminating food insecurity. Most importantly, we can
      see the greatest impact on equality of outcomes by focusing on those who experience
      insecurity and health related issues the most.\n\n1. Reduce the “SNAP gap”\n\nThe
      legislature is currently considering a proposal that would establish a common
      application for individuals who receive state benefits. It would allow those
      individuals who are eligible to simultaneously apply for the supplemental nutrition
      assistance program (SNAP) and other income support and benefit programs when
      the individual applies for or renews MassHealth coverage or other state application
      or renewal process. The legislation address the fact that an estimated 680,000
      people who are receiving MassHealth are likely also eligible for SNAP but are
      not currently enrolled. \n\n1. Fund and expand the Healthy Incentives Program\n\nThe
      statewide Healthy Incentives Program (HIP) was launched in April 2017, which
      will apply a one-dollar incentive on every SNAP benefit dollar spent on vegetables
      and fruits when purchased at four types of SNAP retailers selling locally-grown
      produce: farmers markets, farm stands, community supported agriculture programs,
      and mobile markets. It is modeled after a regional Massachusetts pilot which
      found that participants consumed over 25 percent more fruits and vegetables
      than did non-participants. The proposed bill would permanently establish an
      incentives program that would ensure sustainability of the current 3-year HIP
      and expand the types of SNAP retailers eligible to participate in the program.
      \n\n1. Support the Massachusetts Food Trust initiative\n\nThe Massachusetts
      Food Trust Program, established in 2014, would provide loans, grants and technical
      assistance to support new and expanded healthy food retailers and local food
      enterprises in low- and moderate-income communities. This could include supermarkets,
      corner stores, farmer’s markets, mobile markets, community kitchens, food co-ops,
      food truck commissaries, indoor and outdoor greenhouses, and food distribution
      hubs. This private partnership program was a recommendation of the Grocery Access
      Task Force, a public-private partnership which met for about two years to tackle
      this problem. \n\n### iii.\tUse economic incentives to reduce population health
      risks\n\nOur communities are stronger when families have fair access to services
      and products that are supportive and healthful. Unfortunately, what should be
      simple is frequently made difficult for certain populations, including people
      of color and families trapped in poverty. For example, food marketers target
      unhealthy foods to communities of color and to children,  and when these foods
      contribute to health issues like diabetes and hypertension, little community-based
      support is provided to help manage these conditions. As a result, we see health
      issues persist and those who already experience systemic challenges in their
      daily life have to shoulder additional burdens. We can change this by shifting
      where dollars come from and how we invest in the services that create pathways
      for people, especially those most at risk, to enjoy healthier lives.\n\n1. Tax
      soda and other sugary beverages\n\nThe legislature is currently considering
      a proposal that would create a tiered excise tax on sugary drinks with rates
      based on the amount of added sugar each beverage contains. As the amount of
      sugar increases, the amount of tax would also increase. Sugary drink taxes have
      been successfully implemented across the country, generating significant new
      revenue that can be reinvested in a wide range of programs and creating a reduction
      in the overall consumption of sugary beverages. Researchers have estimated that
      an excise tax of a penny per ounce of sugar on sugar-sweetened beverages would
      prevent 45,900 cases of obesity by 2025, saving the Commonwealth $33.40 for
      every dollar invested in implementation of the bill. Revenue from a tiered excise
      tax could raise approximately $368 million in the first year, and would decrease
      annually as consumption decreases. The revenue would be reinvested into public
      health initiatives, including access to clean and safe drinking water, the Prevention
      and Wellness Trust Fund, and other programs focused on children. \n\n1. Fund
      the Prevention and Wellness Trust Fund\n\nThe Prevention and Wellness Trust
      Fund has increased access to preventative services for nearly one million people
      across the Commonwealth. The Fund does not rely on state funding, but is supported
      by a small assessment on health insurers. The program has been nationally recognized
      as a model because it has increased access to preventative services for nearly
      1 million people across Massachusetts, including 22,000 students with asthma.
      Funding for the program ended in 2017. \n\n> BEST PRACTICE: Access to Contraception\nIn
      November 2017, Governor Baker signed a law making contraception free to all
      Massachusetts women. The bill required Massachusetts health insurance companies
      to provide coverage for most contraceptive drugs, devices and products without
      requiring a copay. Research has long shown that contraception has significant
      health benefits for women because it can reduce the risk for ovarian and endometrial
      cancers, and it can treat conditions like endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome
      or uterine fibroids. On top of that, women with unintended pregnancies are more
      likely to receive delayed or no prenatal care. This legislation will make it
      easier for women to get the health care that they need and to take family planning
      decisions back into their own hands. \n\n### iv.\tInvest in programs that prevent
      harm and foster recovery\n\nViolence and addiction not only affect those directly
      involved, their effects ripple outward among family members and surrounding
      neighborhoods. In 2017, over 1,000 Massachusetts residents died from opioid
      overdose.  In Boston, 16 teenagers were killed by guns, a figure that represents
      a doubling from the previous year. The causes of violent behavior and addition
      are complex. But, if we are going to offer any hope of turning the tide of these
      avoidable deaths, we must focus our efforts on prevention and recovery rather
      than condemnation and punishment.\n\n1. Increase funding for the Shannon Grant
      and the Safe and Successful Youth Initiative\n\nSince 2006, the Commonwealth
      has used the Senator Charles E. Shannon Grant to curb youth violence, gang violence
      and substance abuse through regional, multi-disciplinary efforts. Communication
      across municipal lines and coordination between public safety officers and social
      service agencies is what sets Shannon Grants apart from other efforts to fund
      local law enforcement prevention programs. The Safe and Successful Youth Initiative,
      implemented in 2011 after youth violence in Massachusetts was at an all-time
      high, combines public health and public safety approached to eliminating serious
      violence among high-risk urban youth. The program provides funding to support
      an intervention strategy that provides education, training and workforce development
      programs, as well as street outreach and trauma counseling. Funding programs
      that allow young people to create strong community relationships has a strong
      public health benefit for the youth in the program and for the communities where
      they live, providing a safe place for young people to go every day, with safe
      adults and mentors they can trust. \n\n1. Create better access to long-term
      treatment for people suffering from Substance Use Disorders\n\nMunicipal service
      providers want to better connect individuals with Substance Use Disorders to
      immediate treatment options and offer a continuum of wrap-around services to
      support long-term recovery. Mechanisms to address this include the expansion
      of existing, successful programs to enhance recovery services and the development
      of new tools to support these vital connections. In order to create better access
      to long-term treatment, policy makers must identify successful programs that
      provide for both immediate treatment and long-term services, such as housing,
      food, transportation, or employment; profile successful programs and include
      lessons learned, ways to implement these in other communities, and opportunities
      for expanding these services on a regional or multi-community level; and initiate
      program partnership discussions and develop partnership proposals based on the
      program profile identified. Connecting people to appropriate recovery services
      as soon as possible after an incident/overdoes, such as medically-aided treatment
      and recovery coach monitoring programs, is considered vital to saving lives. \n\n\n\n\n"

      backgrounds.

    text: "As of January 1, 2016, there were over 10,000 people in prison in Massachusetts
      Department of Correction facilities. Among the incarcerated, Black and Latino
      inmates are severely overrepresented. While the state population is 7% Black
      and 11% Latino, the state’s inmates are 27% Black and 25% Latino. We must work
      to reduce the incarceration rate overall, close the racial incarceration gap,
      and address the racial inequities in our justice system. We must also do more
      to support released prisoners as they reenter society.\n\n### i.\tEnd disparate
      incarceration rates among populations of color\n\nPeople of color are disproportionately
      overrepresented in the Massachusetts criminal justice system and throughout
      the country. There can be no denying that “implicit and explicit racial bias
      in policing and arrests lead to more convictions and tougher sentencing of people
      of color.” Recent killings of unarmed black men by police and increased visibility
      of these incidents through social media and activism have raised the profile
      of the issue, and these experiences lead to mistrust of law enforcement personnel.
      Legislators and policy experts must address implicit bias, and must also find
      solutions to regain community trust. \n\n1. Require police departments to conduct
      implicit bias trainings\n\nIn the context of criminal justice, implicit bias
      has a profound effect on the relationship between law enforcement officers and
      residents. Six cities around the country are currently participating in the
      National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice, and a bill is
      currently pending in the State House that would require implicit bias training
      for law enforcement officers in Massachusetts. If we can acknowledge and reduce
      implicit bias, then we can reduce the incidence of unlawful arrests and convictions
      in communities of color, and help to strengthen relationships between police
      and community members, which can have a profound effect on our communities and
      residents of color in the Commonwealth.\n\n1. Pass legislation to require that
      a special prosecutor conduct investigations into death from a police shooting.\n\nThe
      current system to investigate police misconduct has raised questions of impartiality
      across the country. Police departments and prosecutors of the same jurisdiction
      typically work together and rely on one another throughout their careers. When
      prosecutors use special grand juries in a matter of police misconduct, there
      is a legitimate question about whether a conflict of interest exists. If the
      Attorney General were to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate police
      misconduct, it would address this potential conflict of interest and serve as
      a means to improve transparency and accountability. \n\n> \nEmerging PRACTICE:
      Require law enforcement officers to wear body cameras while they are on duty.\nSome
      studies have shown that when police officers wear body cameras, it can improve
      the police-resident encounter. Other research suggests that body cameras do
      not improve the relationship or the trust between the police and residents.
      Boston recently implemented a 100-camera study, and the results of this study
      should inform whether body cameras become required for all law enforcement officers
      while they are on duty. \n\n### ii.\tTransition to a restorative justice framework
      that focuses on rehabilitation and re-integration\n\nResearch shows that increasing
      incarceration rates has minimal impact on reducing crime, and that between 2010
      and 2015, crime dropped faster in states that had declining rates of incarceration.
      Massachusetts still uses several outmoded forms of extreme punishment that are
      not shown to meaningfully reduce recidivism rates. As we look to update our
      criminal justice system, we should adopt a framework of restorative justice
      (i.e., one that repair of harm and rehabilitation) and of addressing the socio-cultural
      roots of crime that can impact our communities. \n\n1. Limit solitary confinement
      in all Massachusetts correctional facilities\n\nHuman rights organizations,
      legal scholars, health professionals and advocates all agree that solitary confinement
      is a violation of basic human rights and should be abolished or severely restricted.
      Most proponents agree that inmates should only be kept in solitary confinement
      if they pose a threat to the prison population and they should be given special
      behavioral programming to address the underlying issues. Any inmate in solitary
      confinement must experience humane treatment and be given access to regular
      programs and services.\nRaise juvenile jurisdiction from 18 to 21 and expunge
      juvenile records.\nCurrently 18-year-olds are automatically tried as adults
      in Massachusetts, but many advocates argue that this should be raised to 21
      for some offenses. There is significant evidence to suggest that the adult brain
      isn’t fully formed until a person is closer to 20 years old, and that the differences
      in brain development lead to challenges with impulse control. Young people who
      remain in the juvenile justice system are far more likely to finish school and
      receive workforce training or coaching than those who land in adult justice
      systems. \nWhen 18-year-olds are tried as adults and sent to adult prisons,
      they are at greater risk of recidivism and developing mental health issues.
      Juvenile records are typically sealed, but if a young person commits a crime
      and is tried as an adult, the record will follow them for the rest of their
      life. \n\n1. Eliminate “fine time” and better evaluate low-income defendants’
      ability to pay\n\nSince 2010, 48 states have increased civil and/or criminal
      fees that are assessed on defendants. Debt accumulated through court-imposed
      fines and fees can show up on an individual’s credit score and consequently
      affect their ability to secure housing or employment. In Massachusetts, criminal
      defendants who cannot afford to pay court-imposed fines can be ordered to serve
      jail time, adding $30 per day onto their debt until it is resolved. This practice
      disproportionately affects low-income people of color. Other proposals would
      allow the court officer to determine a defendants’ ability to pay before assessing
      fines and fees, and would create a more flexible fine system. \n\n1. Repeal
      mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses\n\nMandatory minimum
      sentences can lead to over-incarceration that are disproportionate to the crimes
      committed. People sentenced to mandatory minimum often aren’t eligible for early
      release programs or other transition programs. Instead, particularly for nonviolent
      drug offenses, judges should have the ability to make sentencing decisions on
      a case-by-case basis. \n\n1. Allow for community-based sentencing alternatives
      for people convicted of nonviolent crimes\n\nData suggests that incarceration,
      especially over longer periods of time, is correlated with recidivism. While
      prisons may serve to protect our communities from those who have a high risk
      to offend, these same prisons can end up holding many who have committed non-violent
      crimes. Placing these non-violent offenders in prison may contribute to the
      risk of physical and mental health issues, does add to the economic burden of
      our prison system, and, most importantly, removes these individuals, especially
      women and caretakers, from families and neighborhoods that rely on them. Many
      states, including California and New York, have taken steps to eliminate mandatory
      sentencing for non-violent offenders and create programmatic alternatives to
      hold the offenders accountable for their behavior while reducing the potential
      for lasting negative outcomes from involvement in the prison system. An example
      of this legislation in MA is the Primary Caretakers bill which would keep parents
      and children together as the either parent fulfills their obligations under
      a community-based sentencing alternative.\n\n> BEST PRACTICE: Programs that
      focus on re-entry\nCheshire T.R.U.E. Prison Program, Connecticut: In March 2017,
      Governor Malloy announced that Connecticut Department of Corrections would build
      a new facility to house inmates ages 18-25. The Governor partnered with the
      Vera Institute of Justice on this project. This age group has the highest rates
      of recidivism and the T.R.U.E. (Truthfulness, Respectfulness, Understanding,
      and Elevating) program aims to target this group of inmates differently from
      the adult population and provide special programming and services. \n\nIn Massachusetts,
      Middlesex County Sheriff Peter Koutoujian announced a new program that will
      house offenders age 18-24 in a separate facility beginning in February 2018.
      This is an initiative in collaboration with the Vera Institute of Justice and
      UTEC. This program is modeled on Connecticut’s T.R.U.E. program. According to
      the Sheriff’s office, “Nationwide, 18- to 24-year-olds comprise 10 percent of
      the population, but account for 21 percent of all individuals admitted to adult
      prisons each year.”\n\n\n"
