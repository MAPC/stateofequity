  text: "The Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) is the regional planning agency
    serving the people who live and work in the 101 cities and towns of Metropolitan
    Boston. Our mission is to promote smart growth and regional collaboration. Our
    regional plan, MetroFuture, guides our work as we engage the public in responsible
    stewardship of our region’s future. We work toward sound municipal management,
    sustainable land use, protection of natural resources, efficient and affordable
    transportation, a diverse housing stock, public safety, economic development,
    clean energy, healthy communities, an informed public, and equity and opportunity
    among people of all backgrounds.\n\nMAPC believes that achieving equity is paramount
    to the long-term economic and social well-being and sustainable future of the
    Metro Boston region, as well as the entire Commonwealth. \nWe believe that equity
    means that all people have full and equal access to opportunities that enable
    them to attain their full potential.\n\nIn an equitable region, everyone has equal
    access to opportunities and each resident has a chance to grow up healthy, receive
    a quality education, get a well-paying job that ensures quality of life, and enjoy
    life[^foot] into later years. An equitable Metro Boston is free from discrimination
    that marginalizes people based on race, sex, religion, disability, national origin,
    immigration status, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or marital status,
    income, military status, criminal history, or age. It holds up leaders from marginalized
    groups and centers the experiences of the disenfranchised. MAPC seeks to advance
    equity in the region through our organizational policies and project selection.

      providing compelling detail on inequality across many sectors, including housing,
      transportation, public health, and contaminated environments. In 2014, MAPC
      wrote “The State of Equity in Metro Boston: Policy Agenda” which attempted to
      provide recommendations of policies and implementation steps needed to address
      the disparities highlighted in the 2011 report. In February 2017, MAPC released

  text: "We developed a set of principles to help us[^another] highlight a key set
    of policy strategies, and related policy proposals, to act on in the next five
    years. The principles were developed based on input from a project Advisory Group,
    a review of relevant policy documents (e.g., PolicyLink’s All in Cities Toolkit,
    Minnesota Legislative Report Card on Racial Equity, City of Seattle’s Equity &
    Environment Agenda) and MAPC’s ongoing research into factors that are at the root
    of inequalities in the Metro Boston region. These principles layer on top of one
    another to form a kaleidoscope through which we see a composite rather than through
    one or only a few lenses when looking at how to address regional inequities.\n\n[^another]:
    This a footnote that comes in a different section of the site. "
  subsections:
  - title: Lead with Racial Equity
    anchor: racial-equity
    text: Our current policies often reflect a system that has been historically biased.
      For example, <<drug laws, redlining>>. Race has been a key, if not the main,
      bias present in many of the policies that have produced the disparities identified
      in the Greater Boston region. Accepting this history means that we must push
      forward changes that do not perpetuate policies that reflect past biases. Therefore,
      we seek policies that lead with a race equity frame and that do not exclusively
      attend only to this root cause of inequity. There are a number of other biases
      integrated into our existing policy landscape and that contribute, directly
      or indirectly, to discrimination experienced by other groups. We believe if
      these biases are rectified or removed, we will have a region that includes and
      support all residents, regardless of background.
  - title: Embrace Interdisciplinary Approaches
    anchor: interdisciplinary-approaches
    text: Existing disparities are rarely the result of inequities within one system.
      We support policy changes that weave together multiple disciplines, linking
      together different experiences and knowledge in support of solving common challenges
      (e.g., education, housing, and criminal justice). Several existing and emerging
      coalitions embrace this approach such as those leading the Great Neighborhoods
      Campaign and the Jobs not Jails Campaign. We believe policy changes coming from
      interdisciplinary groups represent the holistic actions necessary to eliminate
      inequitable outcomes.
  - title: Work Inside and Outside Existing Systems
    anchor: inside-outsidesystems
    text: 'Past policy work shows that incremental changes to existing systems can
      address inequalities. However working within existing systems can also allow
      root causes of inequity and past biases to persist or be perpetuated. In order
      to accelerate the realization of a more equitable region we look to policies
      that improve and reform existing systems as well as policies that dismantle
      or remove existing systems in order to create more equitable conditions. '
  - title: Scale Responses to Challenges
    anchor: scale
    text: Policy strategies should reflect the scale of challenge and the context
      of the inequality. We believe policies should reflect a necessary level of investment
      (e.g., funding, technical assistance, relief from statute, etc.) at the proper
      scale (regional, municipal, etc.) in the relevant sector (public or private).
      For example, in some cases, policies should empower cities and towns – individually
      or collectively – to address the disparities present in their communities. In
      other cases, policies will need to go beyond municipal boundaries to address
      causes of inequalities that are pervasive across regions and the state.
  - title: Move from Symptoms to Root Causes
    anchor: symptom-root
    text: Crises require immediate responses and we believe individuals in urgent
      need should receive assistance through programmatic and policy responses. At
      the same time, we also recognize crises – immediate and those that become chronic
      - are frequently symptoms of more systemic issues. The crises have root causes
      in our society, emanating from policies, norms, and practices of a dominant
      culture. Our policy agenda seeks to blend changes that provide short-term relief
      for individuals affected by crises with those that address the root causes of
      the disparities found in our neighborhoods, municipalities, and region.
  - title: Mitigate and Prevent Harm
    anchor: mitigate-harm
    text: Policies that aim to eliminate disparities by addressing inequities are
      meant to prevent or remove harm, rather than just to manage consequences. Therefore,
      we support policies that rectify the uneven distribution of benefits and burdens.
      We also look for new policy proposals that from the start assess potential inequitable
      effects and remedy those elements prior to passage. Evidence that blends evaluation
      results (e.g., “what works” resources) with lived experiences should form the
      basis of the updates to policies undergo in order to assure that future actions
      do not prolong or create harm for those already unfairly burdened.
- title: Policy Agenda 2017 – 2022
  anchor: policy-agenda
  text: "## Policy Agenda 2017 – 2022\nThe policy agenda is made up of six different
    goals that, if achieved, will lead to greater equity across our region. If realized,
    this is what the Metro Boston region will look like in 2022:\n \n### 1.\tWe have
    inclusive, diverse communities where everyone can afford to live and thrive.\n###
    2.\tWe have convenient and affordable options to access good jobs, schools and
    recreation.\n### 3.\tWe have good jobs and pathways to prosperity.\n### 4.\tWe
    solidify our foundation in education by offering affordable and quality education,
    from pre-school to college.\n### 5.\tWe eliminate conditions and harmful environments
    that leave people sick or injured.\n### 6.\tWe have a public safety and justice
    system that protects residents of all backgrounds.\n\nUnder each of these goals,
    we highlight several strategies that will help to achieve the goals and under
    each strategy, we outline policy tactics that the legislature and the Administration
    should pass in order to make our region more equitable.\n\nExample of Policy Agenda
    Layout\n\nGOAL: WE HAVE INCLUSIVE, DIVERSE COMMUNITIES WHERE EVERYONE CAN AFFORD
    TO LIVE AND THRIVE\n\n(Policy Strategy) \nProtect tenants, increase the supply
    of homes that low-and middle-income families can afford to buy, and help all residents
    stay where they live\n\n(Policy Action) *Pass comprehensive zoning reform in order
    to encourage affordable housing production and eliminate discriminatory zoning
    practices.\n**\n\nWe recognize that these goals, strategies and actions are related
    to each other. If, for example, we move towards a restorative justice system,
    this move will have a profound impact on workforce development, housing opportunities
    and public health outcomes. So, although the Policy Agenda identifies specific
    strategies and actions under a particular goal, the document serves as a cohesive,
    interdependent agenda, not as siloed policy change efforts. "
  subsections:
  - title: We have inclusive, diverse communities where everyone can afford to live
      and thrive.
    anchor: diversity
    text: "Metro Boston neighborhoods are becoming more economically segregated and
      racial desegregation lags significantly behind other metropolitan regions. The
      principle drivers of these trends are high housing prices, income disparities,
      and discriminatory lending and renting practices. Our current population and
      housing demand projections estimate that Metro Boston needs to build 435,000
      units of housing – mostly multifamily – between 2010 and 2040 to meet increasing
      demand and maintain current affordability. Unfortunately, we are falling far
      short, meaning that our region is becoming increasingly unaffordable for families.
      Families are increasingly cost-burdened in our region, spending well over 30%
      of their income on housing. \nSince 2012 the rate of cost burden has been trending
      up for the renter population and down for the homeowner population. The trend
      indicates a growing housing cost burden gap between homeowners and renters,
      increasing the vulnerability of the region’s renters who are disproportionately
      people of color. Neighborhoods with a high concentration of cost-burdened residents,
      especially renters, are at risk of rapid population turnover when housing costs
      rise slightly or when these households face economic setbacks. Tempering the
      rising cost of living will be a critical step in ensuring that all Metro Boston
      residents’ earnings are enough to make a home and remain financially stable.
      \nAt the same time, policies that encourage affordability do not necessarily
      promote inclusiveness. Immigrants, both documented and undocumented, are a critical
      component of Metro Boston’s economy and culture. Policies that exclude and ostracize
      immigrants reduce opportunities for them to engage civically, limiting the region’s
      progress. New punitive federal immigration policies put the onus on local governments
      to enact and enforce policies that make immigrants feel safe and that encourage
      them to engage with the people and places around them."
  - title: We have convenient and affordable options to access good jobs, schools
      and recreation
    anchor: affordability
    text: "Metro Boston’s residents depend on the region’s transportation system to
      connect them to school, work, services, and recreational activities. Despite
      the many ways residents of the region get around, transportation improvements
      have tended to promote one form of travel – driving alone – rather than emphasizing
      access to destinations regardless of how a person travels. As a result, many
      residents face substantial challenges when commuting to work, getting to the
      doctor’s office, or visiting friends. This is especially true for low-income
      households who do not own or cannot afford a vehicle, young people and older
      adults who cannot drive, and people with mobility impairments. Those individual
      and household constraints are compounded by historical and ongoing disparities
      in transit service available for low-income communities and communities of color.\n \n##
      Expand transportation options, particularly for underserved populations and
      communities of color, and decrease transportation costs for cost-burdened households.
      \n\nThe region’s commuters of color spend more time commuting than their White
      counterparts. Without a range of convenient transportation options, particularly
      public transit and safe pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, marginalized
      communities have limited mobility options and yet are likely to experience disproportionate
      impacts from vehicular emissions. \n\nThese same communities often spend a disproportionate
      percentage of their household incomes on transportation costs. As MBTA, Commuter
      Rail and event Regional Transit costs continue to rise, we have seen a steady
      decrease in the real dollar value of the gas tax since 1996. Equitable transportation
      means providing a range of travel options to low-income communities and communities
      of color, all of which are affordable, reliable, safe and sustainable.\n \n###
      Enact Regional Transportation Ballot Initiatives to support active transportation
      investments\n\nThis legislation would allow a municipality or group of municipalities
      to raise additional local money for transportation projects via a ballot initiative,
      giving voters a more direct role in the transportation funding process and creating
      a lock box of funds for specific investments. In many communities across our
      region, we expect that these funds would be used to create alternative transportation
      investments, or to increase investments in the existing system. At the same
      time, a frequent criticism of this local option funding mechanism is that it
      will only truly be available to wealthier communities. If it is passed, the
      Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) should ensure that lower-income
      communities have more access to statewide resources. \n\n### Implement road-pricing
      systems that incentivize public transit use\n\nSeveral cities across the United
      States have implemented congestion-pricing schemes. While congestion-pricing
      could be regressive, if implemented here, the region has the opportunity to
      devise a strategy that funnels new money directly to public transit and offers
      exemptions to vehicle-dependent low-income families. \n\n### Implement low-income
      fares for the MBTA, Commuter Rail and RTAs\n\nThe MBTA could implement a low-income
      fare policy whereby riders pay fares on a sliding scale based on their income.
      Additionally, the MBTA should create a fare-capping program for riders who pay
      per trip, rather than for a daily or monthly pass, and ensure that they don’t
      pay more than the cost of the currently offered passes. \n\n**BEST PRACTICE:
      Bus Rapid Transit Pilots**\n\nBus Rapid Transit pilot programs are springing
      up along three key corridors in the MBTA service area. Bus Rapid Transit is
      often seen as a more cost-friendly alternative to building new rail corridors
      along some of our busiest transit routes. Continuing to expand the existing
      pilot program in low-income communities and communities of color could help
      to address inequities in our existing transit system. MAPC will continue to
      play a role in helping the MBTA to determine which corridors should be prioritized
      and to determine the impact of removing parking to accommodate a new dedicated
      bus lane.  \n\n## Adopt equitable decision-making frameworks for transportation
      planning and project development\n\nAn essential part of everyday life for most
      is travel from home to work or to goods and services. The region’s transportation
      systems is the foundation of making commute and utilitarian travel possible
      and the system is sustained through public- and private-sector investment. The
      transportation system that we have is also the result of public- and private-sector
      planning processes, which can tend to focus more heavily on areas that are undergoing
      economic growth and on areas where communities have the capacity to participate
      in decision-making. Since the system serves all in the region, decisions should
      not only favor a few or overly burden specific groups of people, such as households
      of color who are disproportionately burdened by higher transportation costs
      and longer commute times. We can create a more equitable system through greater
      investments in active transportation modes and leading more inclusive planning
      processes. \n\n### Create and enforce developer mitigation policies that direct
      more funding to walking, biking and public transit infrastructure.\n\nThrough
      the development review process, cities and towns should require developers to
      conduct impact studies and manage congestion impacts by making bicycle, pedestrian
      and transit investments. Legislation to assist municipalities, the MassDOT and
      the MBTA create a framework that would direct (additional) developer mitigation
      funds to support transit service and walking and biking infrastructure would
      ensure that such investments are no longer one-off occurrences and are a regular
      investment from new development, especially in locations that rely more heavily
      on non-vehicular travel for daily travel.\n\n**Emerging Practice: Racial equity
      impact assessments**\n\nRacial equity impact assessments analyze the impact
      of budget and policy decisions on racial and ethnic groups and identify ways
      to mitigate the possible consequences of these decisions. They seek to root
      out bias while promoting equity, inclusion, and opportunity. These assessments
      can be applied to any policy or decision making process. \n\nKing County, Washington
      created an Equity Impact Review (EIR) toolkit for informing more equitable budgets,
      policies, and decision making. The King County Department of Transportation
      uses it to make equitable decisions on service reductions or enhancements. The
      Parks Department uses the EIR to more fairly distribute parks, open space, trails,
      and Farmer’s Market by race, income, and language spoken. The county also applied
      the EIR during the creation of their 2012 budget, which resulted in extra allocations
      to truancy prevention, youth programming in diverse low income areas, and economic
      development opportunities in low income communities.\n \n### Offer technical
      assistance funding to support design for low-income communities.\n\nThe Transportation
      Improvement Program (TIP) is the process by which federal transportation dollars
      are allocated to cities and towns in Massachusetts. The current scoring criteria
      favorably views projects that advance equity and support environmental justice
      communities, but requires that projects be at 25% design before they are submitted
      to the TIP. This can be a significant cost burden for communities and can create
      a barrier for those communities that already have transit-dependent residents
      or have transit deserts. A program to increase technical assistance to those
      communities to help them reach 25% design could help level the playing field
      for access to federal transportation dollars. \n\n## Update Project Selection
      Criteria to more holistically consider existing conditions and differences in
      outcomes \n\nTransportation agencies such as Metropolitan Planning Organizations
      (MPOs), and often municipal public works departments, use a set of project evaluation
      criteria to identify priority transportation-related capital investments, given
      constrained financial situations and long range plans. While some progress has
      occurred, many selection criteria continue to prioritize capital and maintenance
      activities that support single occupant automobile travel. Fortunately, there
      are more resources available that allow consideration of a broader set of factors
      and impacts so that criteria promote more equitable outcomes. MPOs and cities
      and towns can put in place policies that place more emphasis on project characteristics
      such as proximity of high volume roadways to residential and education uses,
      socioeconomic context, and access to employment as well as on estimated project
      outcomes on factors like greenhouse gas emissions, displacement risk, injuries,
      and vegetative cover.\n\n**BEST PRACTICES: **Complete Streets\nComplete Streets
      are roadways that are safe, accessible and comfortable for all users, regardless
      of age, physical ability, income, or how they choose to travel: by transit,
      on foot, by bike or public transit. Complete Streets increase safety, promote
      economic development, and enhance public safety. MassDOT offers a special funding
      incentive program to cities and towns that adopt Complete Streets policies.
      MAPC has helped many municipalities to write Complete Streets policies and bicycle
      and pedestrian network plans. To date, 70 cities and towns have registered for
      the MassDOT Complete Streets program, with 44% of those cities and towns serving
      populations at or below the median household income.\n"
  - title: i. Protect tenants, increase the supply of homes that low-and middle-income
      families can afford to buy, and help all residents stay where they live
    anchor: protect-tenants
    text: "The lack of affordable housing options in Metro Boston negatively impacts
      the region’s ability to house our economically and ethnically diverse residential
      base and to support a thriving economy. Half the region’s renters and 30% of
      homeowners are cost burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their annual
      household income on housing. Policy responses to the affordability crisis include
      preserving the existing affordable housing supply, increasing the stock of housing,
      both affordable and market rate, and ensuring that below market-rate units are
      occupied by households with corresponding incomes. \n\n## Pass comprehensive
      zoning reform in order to encourage affordable housing production and eliminate
      discriminatory zoning practices.\nMassachusetts has not updated its zoning laws
      in over 40 years. Municipalities across the Commonwealth use existing zoning
      laws as a way to prevent changes that would allow more affordable homes, condominiums,
      and apartments. An update to the Commonwealth’s outdated zoning laws should
      require cities and towns to create neighborhoods of more affordable homes and
      should encourage municipalities to adopt bylaws or ordinances that require private
      developers to contribute when they are building market rate or luxury housing.
      Both of these tools will help to increase housing affordability in Metro Boston
      and across the Commonwealth.  \nMassachusetts has a long history of residential
      segregation, which can be traced to restrictive local zoning and permitting
      decisions. Comprehensive zoning reform in Massachusetts must promote inclusive
      neighborhoods where families with children and those with low- and moderate-incomes
      can find homes just as easily as those with more wealth or no dependents.\n\n##
      Provide additional funds for preservation and production of affordable homes
      and continue to fund existing smart-growth incentive zoning.\nThe state should
      make financial investments that support municipalities with both production
      and preservation targets related to housing affordability. The state should
      continue to fund the Commonwealth’s smart growth incentive programs under Chapters
      40R and 40S so that cities and towns can feel confident that when they implement
      smart growth zoning overlays, possible impacts on school capacity will be meaningfully
      offset by state funding.\n\n> Emerging Practice: Managing Neighborhood Change
      \nLower-income households are disproportionately impacted by more negative outcomes,
      including housing cost burden and the risk of displacement, that are associated
      with new investment in housing, businesses, and infrastructure. Managing Neighborhood
      Change (MNC) is a data- and community-driven analysis and visioning process
      that engages residents in a community dialogue around neighborhood change, including
      what is welcome and what is cause for concern.  MNC draws on housing and demographic
      data, in addition to resident experiences, to provide strategies that mitigate
      the risks of change and more equitably distribute the benefits of new investments.
      \n\n\n## Pass legislation aimed at increasing protections for renters.\n\nLegislation
      that would give tenants a right to counsel in eviction proceedings, require
      just-cause evictions, and offer tenants the right of first refusal in the event
      that their property is sold will help reduce housing insecurity. When tenants
      are protected in court proceedings, they are more likely to remain in their
      homes. Just-cause eviction laws protect tenants from unfair or discriminatory
      evictions, while a right of first refusal would give tenants an opportunity
      to purchase or assign their right to purchase a property, thereby increasing
      the likelihood that affordable home remains available in the community. Additionally,
      we should pass legislation that would give an income tax credit to landlords
      that rent at below-market rates, helping to incentivize these landlords to maintain
      rents that are affordable, especially for tenants whose wages have not increased,
      and to protect neighborhoods from the effects of gentrification. \n\n### Determine
      affordability based on median income by municipality\n\nCurrently, affordable
      housing eligibility is based on area median income (AMI) for the metropolitan
      statistical area (MSA). For Greater Boston, the MSA is geographically large
      and includes municipalities in Middlesex, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Plymouth
      Counties (and even parts of New Hampshire). Wealthy suburbs in this MSA drive
      up our median income, which ultimately means that most homes that deed-restricted
      as affordable are not actually within financial reach of many who live in Greater
      Boston. Determining affordability based on local median income will ensure that
      deed-restricted housing is available for those who need it most. \n"
