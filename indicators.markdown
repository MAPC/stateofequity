- title: Diversity & Segregation
  text: "Metro Boston is becoming more diverse every decade. In 1970, the region’s
    population was 5% people of color—Asian, Black, Latino, Native American, multiracial
    and other non-White residents; by 2010, that figure had grown to 28%. MAPC projects
    that by 2040 the region will be at least 40% people of color. The region has also
    grown in share of foreign-born residents, and as of 2011-2015, 20% of Metro Boston
    residents were born outside of the U.S. Even as it grows more diverse, the region
    remains racially and economically segregated. \n\nThe Dissimilarity Index, which
    measures the extent to which two groups are similarly distributed across the region,
    has shown decreasing Black – White segregation since 1980. However, the Dissimilarity
    Index for Latinos and Whites is now higher than it was in 1990, indicating a greater
    degree of segregation between the two groups. Other measures of economic segregation
    demonstrate that the region’s poorest households are becoming increasingly concentrated
    into low-income neighborhoods with little income diversity."

  text: 'People of color live in less-affluent neighborhoods than white households
    with comparable earnings. Odds are that a White household earning $78,000 per
    year lives in a neighborhood where the median household income of its neighbors
    is $72,000. Meanwhile, a Black household earning exactly the same is likely to
    live in a neighborhood where the median income is just $51,000. This disparity
    has increased substantially since 2000. '

  text: "In 2011, we found that racial disparities in low birth weight eclipsed the
    differences attributable to education level, most notably for Black women. Based
    on 2005-2009 data, a college-educated Black woman was 40% more likely to have
    a low birth weight baby than a White woman without a high school diploma (8.5%
    among Black women with a college degree, 6.2% among White women with less than
    a high school degree). In 2017, with more recent data, we found that instances
    of low birth weight among Black women have declined slightly (from 10.4% in 2005-2009
    to 9.4% in 2010-2014 among Black women without a high school degree, and from
    8.5% to 7.2% among Black women with a college degree), but the significant preexisting
    disparity means that those gains have not substantially bridged the gap between
    White women and Black women.\n \nRacial health disparities continue into childhood.
    In fact, in the case of childhood asthma, disparities have become more severe
    over time. Data from 2008-2012 show a 10% increase in overall youth asthma hospitalizations,
    compared to data from 2003-2007. This increase was driven by statistically significant
    increases in Black and Latino youth rates. Black youth in the more recent data
    experienced a rate of asthma hospitalization 2.7 times higher than the regional
    average, and climbing. While the rates for Latino youth were closer to the regional
    average, they increased 22% over the five year interval. "

- title: Education
  text: "Standardized test performance improved across almost all demographic categories
    between 2009 and 2015, and the gains were largest for Black and Latino students.
    For the 10th Grade Math MCAS, the percent of Black and Latino students scoring
    Advanced or Proficient grew by 9 percentage points and 7 percentage points, respectively.
    The gap in scores between these groups and White students dropped by 5 points
    and 3 points, though the gaps remain large, at 26 points. These groups also saw
    even larger increases in their four-year graduation rates, and the gap in graduation
    rate with Whites fell by one quarter. Suspension rates in schools with more than
    50% students of color are half of what they were in 2006 – 2007, though they still
    remain twice as high as the average for all schools in the region. \n"

- title: Income
  text: The most recent earnings data show that income polarization is increasing,
    and that this polarization disproportionately affects Black and Latino residents.
    The average income for the highest-earning fifth of households ($280,600) is 18
    times higher than average income for the lowest-income fifth of households ($15,800).
    That disparity has increased by two points since 2006. The highest-income fifth
    earns 15% more than it did in 2006, while the lowest-income fifth earns just 3%
    more. This can be attributed in part to wage polarization and the decline of the
    middle class. This polarization disproportionately affects Black and Latino households,
    whose median household incomes are less than half those of White and Asian households.

- title: Homeownership
  text: Homeownership is one of the cornerstones of building wealth in America. MAPC’s
    2011 report found that people of color—even those who earn a substantial income—face
    continued discrimination in choosing where to live. In particular, high-income
    applicants (those earning more than $118,000 per year) who are Black are more
    than twice as likely to be denied a mortgage as high-income borrowers who are
    White. For Black applicants, the denial rate dropped 4.7 percentage points, and
    for high-income Latino applicants the denial rate dropped 3.3 percentage points.
    While homeownership rates overall have dropped slightly in the last ten years,
    the declines have been most substantial for Black and Latino householders, whose
    homeownership rates (32% and 25%, respectively) are less than half of homeownership
    rates for White householders (68%).

- title: Employment
  text: 'Metro Boston’s economy has been growing robustly since the Great Recession,
    and by the end of 2016 the Metro Boston’s official unemployment rate was 2.5%,
    according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). However, not everyone is benefiting
    equally from this growth. Labor force participation rate (the share of the working-age
    population working or looking for a job) for people with only a high school degree
    is 12 percentage points lower than the rate for those with a bachelor’s degree,
    and trending downward. The unemployment rate for workers who are Black is nearly
    7 percentage points higher than the rate for workers who are White, and the Latino
    rate is nearly 5 points higher. The unemployment rate for people with a disability
    is more than ten percentage points higher than for people without a disability. '

- title: Criminal Justice
  text: Inequities in incarceration follow clear socioeconomic and geographic trends
    that carry significant implications for individuals, families, communities, and
    the region. For individuals, encounters with the criminal justice system can have
    long-term impacts on earning power and employability, as well as mental and physical
    health. The number of inmates in Massachuestts Department of Corrections (DOC)
    facilities statewide dropped by 12% from 2010 to 2016, and the disparities in
    incarceration rate for residents who are Black and Latino also declined, albeit
    slowly. Black and Latino inmates are severely over-represented in (DOC) facilities.
    Although the state population is 7% Black and 11% Latino, the state’s DOC inmates
    are 27% Black and 25% Latino. Native Americans residents, as of 2016, have the
    highest rate of incarceration in the state’s prison system.

- title: Seniors
  text: "As the Baby Boomer generation ages, the region will experience substantial
    growth in the senior population, which may grow by 75% between 2010 and 2030.
    Above-average premature mortality rates for White and Black residents declined
    between 2003-2007 and 2008-2012, while rates for Asian, Latino, and Native American
    residents remained statistically unchanged. Black residents continue to have the
    highest premature mortality rate (348 per 100,000.) \nGrandparents responsible
    for their grandchildren have a poverty rate of more than 15%, double that of grandparents
    not responsible for their grandchildren. Older adults are more housing cost burdened
    (meaning that they pay more than 30% of their income on housing) than younger
    adults. Nearly 60% of renter households headed by an older adult are cost burdened,
    and more than a third of households where the homeowner is an older adult are
    cost burdened. Despite a 5% drop in the total number of housing cost burdened
    young home owners, the renter and owner housing cost burden rates for the elderly
    remained unchanged between 2005-2009 and 2011-2015."

In 2011 MAPC released The State of Equity in Metro Boston, an inventory of cross- sectoral indicators that measured inequity in the region. Those indicators informed the creation of MAPC’s State of Equity Policy Agenda in 2014. MAPC’s 2017 update to the State of Equity indicators report was published in February, 2017 and forms the basis for the agenda put forth in this document. The following section summarizes major findings of the 2017 State of Equity indicators report. Visit the full [State of Equity Report](http://www.regionalindicators.org/topic_areas/7), with many more indicators.

The indicators suggest that conditions which contribute to inequity are persisting or becoming more severe: discrimination, whether overt or systemic, continues to limit opportunity for residents of color and residents with disabilities; income and wealth disparity is increasing, dimming the prospects for upward mobility; and residential segregation, especially segregation by income, is becoming more severe.
